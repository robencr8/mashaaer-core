# Known Issues and Limitations - Mashaaer Feelings Android App

This document outlines the known issues, limitations, and workarounds for the current version of the Mashaaer Feelings Android application.

## Network Connectivity

### Issues
- **Server Connection Timeout**: When the app cannot reach the server, there might be a delay of up to 5 seconds before falling back to local mode.
- **Intermittent Connection**: On unstable networks, the app may switch between online and offline modes unexpectedly.

### Workarounds
- Ensure stable internet connection when using the app
- For consistently poor connections, the app will default to local analysis mode

## Language Support

### Issues
- **Voice Recognition Accuracy**: Voice recognition is more accurate in English than in Arabic. This is a limitation of the underlying voice recognition technology.
- **Arabic Text Analysis**: Local emotion analysis for Arabic text uses a simplified ruleset compared to server-based analysis.

### Workarounds
- For most accurate Arabic language analysis, ensure server connectivity
- Speak clearly and in a quiet environment for optimal voice recognition

## Emotion Analysis

### Issues
- **Local Analysis Limitations**: The offline analysis mode uses a simplified emotion model with fewer emotion categories and potentially less accuracy.
- **Context Awareness**: The current version analyzes each input independently without maintaining conversation context.

### Workarounds
- Use server connection when possible for more sophisticated analysis
- Provide more detailed input text for better emotion detection in offline mode

## Performance

### Issues
- **Initial Startup Time**: First launch may take 3-5 seconds on older devices
- **Recording Memory Usage**: Continuous voice recording for over 1 minute may increase memory usage

### Workarounds
- Allow app to fully initialize on first launch before interaction
- Keep voice recordings to under 1 minute for optimal performance

## User Interface

### Issues
- **Text Field Scrolling**: In some cases, the text input field may not automatically scroll when text exceeds visible area
- **Animation Smoothness**: The cosmic sphere animation may appear less smooth on lower-end devices

### Workarounds
- Manually scroll in text field if needed
- No workaround needed for animations as they don't affect core functionality

## Device Compatibility

### Issues
- **Android 8.0 Requirement**: The app requires Android 8.0 (API level 24) or higher
- **Screen Size Variations**: On extremely small or large screens, some UI elements may appear disproportionate

### Workarounds
- No workaround for minimum Android version - this is a hard requirement
- The app is optimized for smartphone screens between 5-7 inches

## Permissions

### Issues
- **Permission Explanations**: Some Android versions may not clearly explain why certain permissions are needed
- **Microphone Access**: If microphone permission is denied, voice input functionality won't work

### Workarounds
- Manually grant permissions through device settings if initially declined
- The app will provide instructions on how to enable needed permissions

## Future Improvements

The following limitations are known and planned for improvement in future releases:

1. **Extended Emotion Set**: Expanding the emotion detection categories
2. **Improved Arabic Support**: Enhanced Arabic language processing
3. **Conversation Context**: Maintaining context across multiple interactions
4. **UI Refinements**: More responsive and adaptive interface
5. **Battery Optimization**: Reduced power consumption during extended use
6. **Offline Voice Recognition**: Better offline voice processing
