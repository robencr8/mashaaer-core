# Known Issues and Limitations

## Web Application Feedback Tool Connectivity

### Issue Description
The web application feedback tool reports that the server is unreachable despite successful access via browser and curl tests. This appears to be a specific incompatibility between the feedback tool and our application server.

### Impact
- The feedback tool cannot be used for direct interaction with our application
- All manual testing through browsers and API testing via curl works correctly
- This is strictly a testing tool issue, not an end-user facing problem

### Extensive Troubleshooting Performed

We've taken the following troubleshooting steps to isolate and attempt to resolve the issue:

1. **CORS Configuration**
   - Added explicit CORS headers to all endpoints
   - Tested with wildcard origin (`*`) and specific origins
   - Created endpoints with various CORS configurations
   - Verified CORS preflight requests work correctly

2. **Minimal Endpoints**
   - Created ultra-minimal endpoints with no dependencies
   - Added simple health check endpoint at root level (`/health`)
   - Developed multiple test endpoints with different response types
   - Created standalone minimal server implementations

3. **Network Verification**
   - Confirmed server is accessible via curl and browser
   - Verified local connectivity to all endpoints
   - Created diagnostic endpoints with detailed request/response information
   - Added extensive logging for all incoming requests (including dedicated `/readme` route)

4. **Custom Testing**
   - Developed separate test scripts to verify connectivity
   - Created specialized diagnostic HTML pages
   - Added comprehensive debug logging
   - Tested with various content types and response formats

### Workarounds

Use the following alternatives for testing:

1. **Browser Testing**
   - Access the application directly through your browser
   - Use the browser's developer tools to inspect network requests and responses

2. **API Testing**
   - Use curl commands for API endpoint testing
   - Example: `curl -v http://localhost:5000/api/status`

3. **Diagnostic Pages**
   - Access `/api/status` for a detailed server status report
   - Visit `/diagnostic` for comprehensive connection testing
   - Check `/cors-test-enhanced` for CORS configuration verification

4. **Health Verification**
   - Check the `/health` endpoint for a simple status check
   - Use `/api/ping` for a JSON response confirming server status

### Diagnostic Tools

The following specialized diagnostic tools are available:

1. **Test Scripts**
   - `test_server_connectivity.py` - Tests various endpoints and CORS configurations
   - `test_feedback_tool_connectivity.py` - Specifically tests compatibility with the feedback tool

2. **Diagnostic Pages**
   - `/diagnostic` - Comprehensive diagnostic page
   - `/minimal-test` - Ultra-minimal test page
   - `/cors-test-enhanced` - Advanced CORS testing page
   - `/feedback-tool-test` - Specialized page for feedback tool testing
   - `/readme` - Project documentation and overview page

3. **Standalone Servers**
   - `standalone_minimal_server.py` - Independent minimal server on port 3000
   - `ultra_minimal_server.py` - Ultra-minimal server implementation
   - `truly_minimal_server.py` - The most minimal possible server configuration

### Future Investigation

Potential avenues for future investigation when time permits:

1. Contact Replit support regarding potential networking incompatibilities
2. Explore detailed network packet capture to analyze the exact communication differences
3. Investigate if the feedback tool has specific requirements not documented
