# Web Application Feedback Tool Update - April 4, 2025

## Latest Findings on TTS Functionality

Recent tests with the text-to-speech (TTS) functionality confirm that:

- The server correctly processes requests to the `/tts-test` endpoint
- API calls to `/api/speak` are successfully generating audio via ElevenLabs
- Audio files are being correctly cached and served from the `/tts_cache/` directory
- The browser console logs show successful playback: `Audio playback started successfully`

## Feedback Tool Connection Details

- The feedback tool is attempting to access: `https://b846eda6-3902-424b-86a3-00b49b2e7d19-00-m9cxfx7bc3dj.worf.replit.dev/tts-test`
- Server logs show successful processing of these requests, despite the tool reporting connectivity issues
- The TTS test HTML page loads correctly and shows both the Web API and Mobile API test buttons

## Network Request Analysis

**Request Details:**
- Method: POST
- URL: `/api/speak`
- Headers:
  - Origin: `https://b846eda6-3902-424b-86a3-00b49b2e7d19-00-m9cxfx7bc3dj.worf.replit.dev:5000`
  - Referer: `https://b846eda6-3902-424b-86a3-00b49b2e7d19-00-m9cxfx7bc3dj.worf.replit.dev:5000/tts-test`
  - Content-Type: `application/json`
- Body: `{"text": "This is a test message for TTS playback verification.", "language": "en"}`

**Response:**
- Status: 200 OK
- Audio file: `tts_cache/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM_3aac028364dcee90d6484c8956d71b44.mp3`
- File size: 49782 bytes

## Suspected Issues

The problem is likely related to one of the following:

1. **Port Access**: The app is running on port 5000, but the feedback tool might be trying to access it without specifying the port correctly
2. **URL Format**: There might be a mismatch in how URLs are formatted between the feedback tool and the application
3. **CORS Settings**: Despite having comprehensive CORS settings, there might be a specific configuration the feedback tool requires

## CORS Configuration

Current CORS configuration allows these origins:
- `https://b846eda6-3902-424b-86a3-00b49b2e7d19-00-m9cxfx7bc3dj.worf.replit.dev`
- `https://workspace.robenedwan.repl.co`
- `https://workspace--robenedwan.repl.co`
- Wildcard (`*`) as a fallback for maximum compatibility

## Conclusion

The TTS functionality is working as expected when accessed directly. The issue appears to be specific to how the feedback tool attempts to connect to the application. The application itself is stable and functional, with all core features including TTS working correctly.

Recommended approach is to continue with direct browser testing and functional verification while acknowledging the limitations of the feedback tool integration.
