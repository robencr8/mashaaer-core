# Known Issues

## Web Application Feedback Tool Connectivity

Despite extensive debugging and configuration efforts, the web application feedback tool consistently reports that the server is unreachable, even though all other access methods (browsers, curl, etc.) can successfully reach the server.

### Symptoms
- The web application feedback tool reports "Web server is unreachable"
- Manual browser testing shows all endpoints are accessible 
- curl commands to the same endpoints return successful responses
- Server logs show no errors when processing requests

### Investigation Summary
1. **CORS Configuration**: We've implemented maximally permissive CORS headers across all endpoints
2. **Minimal Endpoints**: Created ultra-minimal endpoints with no dependencies
3. **Standalone Server**: Tested with a completely independent minimal server
4. **Network Analysis**: Confirmed network connectivity via multiple tools
5. **Origin Checking**: Allowed all origins and tried specific origin matching
6. **Content Types**: Ensured appropriate content types are returned
7. **Root-Level Endpoint**: Added `/health` endpoint for minimal verification

### Workarounds
- Use the browser directly to test the application functionality
- Use the curl commands documented in the feedback tool guide
- Use the comprehensive feedback test page for detailed diagnostics

### Next Steps
If you continue to experience issues with the web application feedback tool, please try the following:

1. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Try accessing the application directly via the URL (not through the feedback tool)
3. Test minimal endpoints like `/health` and `/api/minimal` directly
4. Use the curl commands in the feedback tool guide for command-line testing

## Other Known Issues

### Voice Recognition
- Voice recognition may not work in some browsers due to microphone access restrictions
- Safari has limited support for some audio features

### Mobile API Integration
- Mobile API endpoints require proper authentication headers
- Some mobile features may have reduced functionality in offline mode
