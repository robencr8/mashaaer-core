# Web Application Feedback Tool Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for troubleshooting and working with the web application feedback tool in the context of the Mashaaer Feelings application.

## Current Status

Despite extensive troubleshooting, the web application feedback tool consistently reports that the server is unreachable. All other methods of accessing the server (browsers, curl, etc.) work correctly. This appears to be a specific incompatibility between the feedback tool and our server configuration.

## Diagnostic Tools

### Testing Scripts

1. **run_diagnostics.py**
   - Comprehensive diagnostic tool that runs all tests and generates a report
   - Usage: `python run_diagnostics.py`

2. **test_server_connectivity.py**
   - Tests basic server connectivity and CORS configuration
   - Usage: `python test_server_connectivity.py [base_url]`

3. **test_feedback_tool_connectivity.py**
   - Specifically tests endpoints for compatibility with the feedback tool
   - Usage: `python test_feedback_tool_connectivity.py [base_url]`

### Standalone Servers

1. **standalone_minimal_server.py**
   - Complete standalone server with minimal dependencies
   - Runs on port 3000 to avoid conflicts with the main application
   - Usage: `python standalone_minimal_server.py`

2. **ultra_minimal_server.py**
   - Ultra-minimal server implementation with basic endpoints
   - Usage: `python ultra_minimal_server.py`

3. **truly_minimal_server.py**
   - The most minimal possible server implementation
   - Usage: `python truly_minimal_server.py`

### Diagnostic Endpoints

The main application includes various diagnostic endpoints:

1. `/health`
   - Basic health check endpoint returning "OK"
   - Includes CORS headers for maximum compatibility

2. `/api/ping`
   - Returns JSON response confirming server status
   - Includes timestamp and server status information

3. `/api/status`
   - Returns detailed server status information
   - Includes environment details, configuration and component status

4. `/api/debug-request`
   - Returns detailed information about the incoming request
   - Includes all headers, origin, and request parameters

5. `/api/minimal`
   - Ultra-minimal endpoint returning plain text
   - Explicitly configured with all necessary CORS headers

### Diagnostic Pages

1. `/diagnostic`
   - Comprehensive diagnostic page with interactive tests
   - Tests various endpoints, CORS configurations, and request types

2. `/minimal-test`
   - Minimal test page with basic connectivity checks
   - Uses simple fetch requests to test server accessibility

3. `/cors-test-enhanced`
   - Advanced CORS testing page with detailed diagnostics
   - Tests various origin configurations and preflight requests

4. `/feedback-tool-test`
   - Specialized page for testing the feedback tool connectivity
   - Minimal HTML with just enough code to verify connectivity

## Troubleshooting Guide

If you're experiencing issues with the web application feedback tool, follow these steps:

1. Verify server is running:
   ```
   curl -v http://localhost:5000/health
   ```

2. Verify API accessibility:
   ```
   curl -v http://localhost:5000/api/status
   ```

3. Check diagnostic information:
   ```
   curl -v http://localhost:5000/api/debug-request
   ```

4. Run comprehensive diagnostics:
   ```
   python run_diagnostics.py
   ```

5. Test standalone server:
   ```
   python standalone_minimal_server.py
   ```

6. Visit diagnostic pages in your browser:
   - http://localhost:5000/diagnostic
   - http://localhost:5000/minimal-test
   - http://localhost:5000/cors-test-enhanced

## Workarounds

Since the web application feedback tool consistently reports connectivity issues, you can use the following alternatives for testing:

1. **Direct Browser Testing**
   - Use your browser to directly interact with the application
   - Use browser developer tools to inspect network activity and console logs

2. **API Testing with curl**
   - Test API endpoints using curl commands
   - Example: `curl -v http://localhost:5000/api/analyze-emotion -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text":"I am feeling happy today"}'`

3. **Diagnostic Pages**
   - Use the diagnostic pages included in the application
   - These pages provide detailed information and interactive testing

4. **Server Logs**
   - Monitor server logs to track requests and responses
   - Look for specific CORS-related information or errors

## Additional Notes

The feedback tool connectivity issue appears to be related to specific requirements or configurations in the Replit environment. All standard accessibility and CORS tests pass, suggesting this is not a conventional web server configuration issue.
