# Mood-Based Adaptive Theme System

The **Mashaaer Feelings** application now features a dynamic mood-based adaptive theme system that changes the visual appearance based on detected emotions. This creates a more immersive and responsive user experience that reflects the emotional state of the conversation.

## Key Features

- **Emotion-Responsive UI**: The entire application interface smoothly transitions between different color schemes and animations based on the detected emotion.
- **Seamless Transitions**: All theme changes include smooth CSS transitions for a fluid visual experience.
- **Modular Design**: The theme system is implemented as a standalone module that can be easily integrated with any page.
- **Multilingual Support**: Works with both Arabic and English interfaces.
- **PWA Compatible**: Fully compatible with the Progressive Web App implementation.

## Supported Emotions

The theme system currently supports the following emotions:

1. **Happy** - Golden theme with bright, energetic animations
2. **Sad** - Blue theme with slower, gentle animations
3. **Angry** - Red-orange theme with intense, quick animations
4. **Calm** - Turquoise theme with slow, peaceful animations
5. **Neutral** - Purple theme (default) with balanced animations

## How to Test

You can view a demo of the theme system at `/test-themes` which allows you to switch between different emotion themes and see how the UI elements respond.

The theme system is integrated with the emotion detection so that when the application detects an emotion, the theme will automatically change to match.
