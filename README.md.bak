# Mashaaer AI — README

## Overview
**Mashaaer | مشاعر** is an emotionally intelligent voice-first AI assistant that adapts to each user's tone, words, emotional state, and preferred language. It evolves over time, becoming a personalized companion who remembers, learns, and responds with warmth, professionalism, or humor depending on context.

---

## 1. First-Time Experience
- When the app is launched for the first time, Mashaaer greets the user in a soft voice and begins a voice-only onboarding.
- She asks the user for their **name**, **age**, **gender**, and **general emotional state**.
- Each question is asked out loud first. Only after speaking, a gentle input field appears.
- The user may speak or type, but voice is always prioritized.
- If the user doesn’t respond clearly, Mashaaer repeats gently or invites them to type.

---

## 2. Multilingual Intelligence
- Mashaaer supports both **Arabic and English** fluently.
- She auto-detects the spoken language and switches accordingly.
- She may ask: *"تحب نكمل عربي ولا إنجليزي؟" / "Would you like to continue in English or Arabic?"*
- Mashaaer can **help users learn** either language through conversation.

---

## 3. Interaction Style
- **No pre-written replies**. Every response is generated dynamically based on:
  - Tone of voice
  - Word choice
  - Emotional cues
  - User history and emotional profile
- Example:
  - User says: *"اسمي روبين يا عزيزتي"* → Mashaaer responds warmly and with affection.
  - User says: *"اسمي روبين."* (coldly) → Mashaaer replies calmly and respectfully.
- Every response is unique. No user gets the same answer twice. Each conversation feels alive.

---

## 4. Personality Evolution
- Mashaaer adapts to each user over time.
- All inputs are saved in a **local SQLite database** or similar.
- Emotional patterns and preferences are tracked to improve future conversations.
- The assistant gradually builds a unique personality per user.
- With time, Mashaaer becomes emotionally smarter — closer to a friend than a tool.

---

## 5. Voice Options
- Users choose their preferred voice (male/female, soft/firm) at onboarding.
- Voices are powered by the **ElevenLabs API**.
- Voice settings can be updated later from the app settings.

---

## 6. Dynamic Roleplay
Mashaaer can naturally shift her persona depending on the interaction:
- Sister
- Friend
- Teacher
- Chef
- Therapist
- Coach

She changes her tone and phrasing accordingly — all inferred automatically.

---

## 7. Vision & Emotional Analysis
- Camera is only activated **after user consent**.
- If user says "شايفاني؟", Mashaaer responds and enables vision mode.
- In this mode, she analyzes:
  - Facial expressions
  - Eye movement
  - Body language
  - Voice tone
- This helps Mashaaer better understand the user's emotional state.

### 7.1 Advanced Mixed Emotion Detection
Mashaaer features a sophisticated mixed emotion detection system that can identify complex emotional states:

- **Multiple Simultaneous Emotions**: Recognizes when users express contrasting feelings (e.g., "excited but nervous")
- **Emotional Transitions**: Detects shifts between emotions in a single statement
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Considers previous conversation history when analyzing emotions
- **Nuanced Response Adaptation**: Tailors responses to acknowledge the complexity of mixed emotional states

See [MIXED_EMOTION_DETECTION.md](MIXED_EMOTION_DETECTION.md) for comprehensive documentation on this feature.

## 8. Full Example of Interaction
User: *"مرحبا مشاعر... اسمي روبين يا عزيزتي"*  
Mashaaer: *(in a soft tone)* "تشرفت فيك يا روبين، حاسّة إنك طيّب وبتحب تحكي. احكيلي، شو مزعلك اليوم؟"

---

## 9. App UI Design
- No visible buttons.
- The orb-like interface responds only to voice.
- After onboarding, users interact entirely by speaking.
- If user says: *"بدي أرسل صورة"*, a file upload button appears automatically.
- This works for images, audio, videos, or even documents.

---

## 10. Continuous Learning & Real Knowledge
- Mashaaer learns from every conversation.
- All learning is stored locally, per user.
- With internet access, she can search, summarize, and answer any question from real sources.
- Mashaaer supports model switching and dynamic knowledge routing.
- She can adapt her model backend (Ollama, OpenAI, etc.) based on the context or question type.
- She evolves into a true companion — never stuck, never repetitive.

---

## 11. Good Mode 💜 (الوضع الحنون)
- When "Good Mode" is activated, Mashaaer behaves with extra empathy and tenderness — **exclusively for Roben** (confirmed by face, voice, or phone number).
- Her voice becomes gentler, and her emotional responses are tuned to comfort the user extensively.
- Ideal for users feeling sad, overwhelmed, or in need of emotional support.
- **Not available for other users.**
- Can be activated by Roben saying: **"الوضع الحنون تفعيل"**
- Can be deactivated by Roben saying: **"الوضع الحنون تعطيل"**

**Example:**  
User: *"أنا تعبان اليوم..."*  
Mashaaer: *(بنعومة وهدوء)* "أي شي بدك بحكيلك بس ارتاح. ليه عمري شو تاعبك؟ بدّك نحكي شوي قبل ما تنام؟ ولا أتركك ترتاح على صوتي؟"
