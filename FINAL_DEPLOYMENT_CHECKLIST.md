- [ ] Create/update installation and setup guide

### Final Testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing of main user flows

## Notes
- The web application feedback tool has known connectivity issues as documented in KNOWN_ISSUES.md
- ElevenLabs API keys should be kept secure and not exposed to the frontend
- Consider implementing usage monitoring for paid services (ElevenLabs, Twilio)
- SMS functionality requires valid Twilio credentials to be operational
