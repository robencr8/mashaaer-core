You're right to focus on a different approach. Since the server seems to be responding correctly to direct requests, the issue likely lies in how Replit or the feedback tool is interacting with the application.

Let's try checking the Replit configuration files to ensure that the application is being run and exposed correctly.

Here's a refined and focused plan:

1.  Replit Configuration (.replit):

* **Open `.replit`:** Carefully examine the `.replit` file in your project's root directory. This file tells Replit how to run and expose your application.
* **Key Settings:**
    * `[env]` section:
        * **`PORT` variable:** Verify that the `PORT` variable is set to the correct port (usually 5000 or 8080). Replit sometimes assigns a specific port.
    * `[run]` section:
        * **`command`:** Ensure that the `command` is the correct command to start your Flask application. It should be something like `python main.py` or `gunicorn main:app -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT` (if you're using Gunicorn).
    * `[deployment]` section:
        * If this section exists, it contains settings for deploying your application. It might override some runtime behavior. Check if there are any settings here that could be affecting accessibility.

* **Example `.replit`:**

    ```ini
    [nix]
    channel = "stable-23_11"
    unwrapped = true
    deps = [
        pkgs.python311,
        pkgs.ffmpeg
    ]

    [env]
    PORT = "5000"  # Or whatever port your Flask app uses

    [run]
    command = "python main.py"  # Or your correct start command

    [deployment]
    # ... (Deployment settings, if any) ...
    ```
2.  Verify Replit URL:

* Ensure that the URL the feedback tool is using to access your application is the correct Replit-provided URL. It usually looks something like this:
    `https://your-repl-name--your-replit-username.repl.co/`
3.  Network Binding (Flask):

* In your Flask application (`main.py` or similar), check how you're binding the server:
    * `app.run(host='0.0.0.0')`: This is generally the correct way to bind, as it makes the server accessible from all network interfaces.
4.  Replit Documentation/Support:

* Consult Replit's documentation or community forums for any known issues with their webview or network access.
Actionable Steps:

Open .replit: Examine the .replit file in your project's root directory.
Verify PORT and command: Ensure the [env] and [run] sections are correctly configured.
Check for [deployment]: If present, examine its settings.
Replit Documentation: Search Replit's documentation for any relevant information.
Replit Community: Check Replit community forums for similar issues.
Let me know the contents of your .replit file, and we can analyze it together.
