That's fantastic progress! An increase from 44.8% to 96.6% is a testament to your focused approach and iterative refinement. Achieving perfect scores across most emotion categories is a significant accomplishment.

You've correctly identified the remaining challenge: accurately classifying mixed emotions, as seen in the "excited about the new project" test case. This is a common and complex problem in emotion analysis, as humans often experience multiple emotions simultaneously.

Here's how we can address this:

1. Analyze the Misclassification:

Examine the Input Text: Carefully look at the "While I am excited about the new project..." sentence. What are the specific keywords or phrases that indicate different emotions?
Review the Current Logic: Inspect the analyze_text and _analyze_with_rules methods in emotion_tracker.py. How does your code currently handle multiple emotion keywords within a single sentence? Does it prioritize one emotion over others?
2. Implement Improved Mixed Emotion Handling:

There are several strategies we could explore, with increasing complexity:

Weighted Scoring: Instead of simply assigning a single emotion, you could assign scores to all detected emotions based on the presence and weight of their keywords. Then, you could either:
Return a list of emotions with their scores.
Return the top two emotions if their scores are close, indicating a mixed emotion.
Contextual Analysis (Advanced):
If you're using more advanced NLP techniques, you could try to understand the relationships between words and their emotional impact. For example, in "I am excited but anxious," the "but" suggests a contrast between the two emotions.
Dependency parsing or semantic role labeling could be helpful here, but they add complexity.
Rule-Based Refinements:
You could add specific rules to detect patterns that indicate mixed emotions. For example, if both "excited" and "anxious" keywords are present, you could return "mixed."
This approach can become difficult to maintain as the complexity grows.
3. Implementation Example (Weighted Scoring - Simplified):

Here's a simplified example of how you might implement weighted scoring within your _analyze_with_rules method:

Python

def _analyze_with_rules(self, text: str) -> Union[str, List[Tuple[str, float]]]:
    text = text.lower()
    emotions: Dict[str, float] = defaultdict(float)
    # ... (your existing keyword matching logic) ...

    if re.search(r"\b(excited|thrilled)\b", text):
        emotions["happy"] += 0.8  # Example weight for excited
    if re.search(r"\b(anxious|worried)\b", text):
        emotions["sad"] += 0.6  # Example weight for anxious

    if emotions:
        # If you want just the top emotion:
        # return max(emotions, key=emotions.get)

        # If you want a list of emotions with scores:
        emotion_list = sorted(emotions.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
        if len(emotion_list) > 1 and abs(emotion_list[0][1] - emotion_list[1][1]) < 0.2:  # Threshold for "mixed"
            return emotion_list[:2]  # Return the top two
        else:
            return emotion_list[0][0]  # Return the dominant emotion
    return "neutral"
Important: This is a simplified example. You'll need to adapt it to your specific keyword dictionaries and scoring logic.

4. Testing the Mixed Emotion Handling:

Add more test cases to test_expanded_phrases.py that specifically target mixed emotion scenarios.
Write assertions that check for the presence of both expected emotions (or the correct list of emotions) rather than just a single emotion.
Before diving into the implementation, let's discuss:

Which approach to mixed emotion handling seems most appropriate for your application?
Do you have any existing logic that might be relevant to this?
What are your priorities in terms of accuracy vs. complexity?
Let me know your thoughts, and we can refine the code together!
