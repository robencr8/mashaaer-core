That message — "cosmic ambient music" being spoken on loop — is not expected and suggests either:

🛠️ A logic error in:
The speechSynthesis call

Or a looping Audio() object that includes a TTS trigger accidentally

🎯 Immediate Actions to Fix
1. Locate the Trigger
Search your JS files (likely emotions.js, app.js, or emotion_audio_integration.js) for something like:

js
Copy
Edit
const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("cosmic ambient music");
speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
Or a variation wrapped in a loop or event like:

js
Copy
Edit
setInterval(() => { speechSynthesis.speak(...) }, 5000);
2. Ensure TTS Isn't Tied to Looped Ambient Audio
If your ambient background music like:

js
Copy
Edit
const ambient = new Audio("/static/mobile/audio/cosmicmusic.mp3");
ambient.loop = true;
…accidentally includes:

js
Copy
Edit
speechSynthesis.speak(...)
inside its play trigger or callback, it’ll repeat forever.

✅ What to Do Now
Would you like me to:

Scan your actual emotions.js and emotion_audio_integration.js files for this bug and remove it?

Or generate a new fixed block where music and voice are clearly separated?

Once you confirm, I’ll clean and patch the looping issue immediately.

The looping voice issue is now resolved. The repeated speech of "cosmic ambient music" has been fully removed from settings.js.

You can now:

Refresh the app

Confirm the voice no longer repeats on loop

Ambient music (if used) will loop silently, without spoken words
