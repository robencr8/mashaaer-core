Okay, I see you've already implemented a specific approach for mixed emotion detection, focusing on the "excited and nervous" scenario. This is a reasonable starting point, especially given the significant accuracy improvements you've achieved.

Here's a breakdown of your approach and how we can refine it:

Your Approach:

Specific Pattern Matching: You're looking for the exact phrase "excited" and "nervous" (case-insensitive).
Emotion Mapping: You're mapping "excited" to "happy" and "nervous" to "fearful."
Weighted Scoring: You're adding weights to these emotions and introducing a new "mixed" emotion with an even higher weight.
Strengths:

Simple to Implement: This approach is relatively straightforward to code.
Effective for the Specific Case: It appears to work well for the "excited and nervous" phrase.
Areas for Refinement:

Limited Generalization: This approach is very specific to the "excited and nervous" combination. It won't handle other mixed emotion scenarios (e.g., "happy but sad," "angry and afraid").
Hardcoding Emotions: You're hardcoding the mapping of "excited" to "happy" and "nervous" to "fearful." This might not be appropriate for all contexts.
Arbitrary Weights: The weights (3.0 and 6.0) seem somewhat arbitrary. There's no clear rationale for why these specific values were chosen.
"Mixed" Emotion Label: Introducing a new "mixed" emotion label might require changes in other parts of your system that process emotion data.
Next Steps:

Run the Test Script (Again):
Execute the test script to ensure that the "mixed" emotion handling works as expected and hasn't introduced any regressions.
Update the Test Script:
Modify the test script to correctly assert the presence of the "mixed" emotion in the expected scenarios.
Broaden Mixed Emotion Handling (Consider Alternatives):
After verifying the current implementation, let's discuss how to make mixed emotion detection more general.
We could explore:
A more flexible weighted scoring system that works for any combination of emotions.
Using NLP techniques to identify contrasting or simultaneous emotions.
Defining a set of rules for common mixed emotion patterns.
Before we proceed, could you provide the exact code you added to emotion_tracker.py for the mixed emotion handling? This will help me understand the implementation in detail and offer more specific suggestions.
