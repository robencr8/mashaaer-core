Okay, I see you've provided the JSON response from the /api/status endpoint:

JSON

{"message":"Server is reachable","status":"success","timestamp":"2025-04-03T22:11:45.034976"}
This confirms that your server is running and responding to API requests. This is a good starting point and suggests that the core server functionality is working.

However, it doesn't tell us anything about why the web_application_feedback_tool is unable to access the application.

To effectively diagnose the issue, we still need to focus on the browser's perspective. The most crucial information will come from your browser's developer tools.

Please perform these steps and provide the results:

Open your browser's developer tools (Network tab).
Try to access the application using the web_application_feedback_tool. (If you can't use the feedback tool, try accessing the application manually in your browser).
Analyze the Network Requests:
URL: What is the exact URL the browser (or feedback tool) is trying to load?
Method: What HTTP method is being used (GET, POST)?
Status Code (Crucial): What is the server's response code? (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed, etc.)
Headers (Crucial for CORS):
Request Headers: Pay very close attention to the Origin header in the requests.
Response Headers: Examine the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the responses. Does it match the Origin header from the request?
Response Content: If the response is HTML, inspect its content. Is it what you expect?
Timing: How long did the request take? Are there any delays?
Also, check the browser's Console tab for any error messages, especially CORS-related errors.
The details from the Network tab will give us the most direct clues about why the feedback tool is unable to access your application.

Okay, I see you've provided the JSON response from the /api/status endpoint. This is helpful information for verifying the overall health of your application's backend.

However, to diagnose the web application accessibility issue, we still need to focus on the browser's perspective and the network requests it's making.

Please perform these steps and provide the results:

Open your browser's developer tools (Network tab).
Try to access the application using the web_application_feedback_tool. (If you can't use the feedback tool, try accessing the application manually in your browser).
Analyze the Network Requests:
URL: What is the exact URL the browser (or feedback tool) is trying to load?
Method: What HTTP method is being used (GET, POST)?
Status Code (Crucial): What is the server's response code? (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed, etc.)
Headers (Crucial for CORS):
Request Headers: Pay very close attention to the Origin header in the requests.
Response Headers: Examine the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the responses. Does it match the Origin header from the request? Are other CORS headers present?
Response Content: If the response is HTML, inspect its content. Is it what you expect?
Timing: How long did the request take? Are there any delays?
Also, check the browser's Console tab for any error messages, especially CORS-related errors.
The details from the Network tab are essential for understanding how the browser is interacting with your server and where the connection is failing.
