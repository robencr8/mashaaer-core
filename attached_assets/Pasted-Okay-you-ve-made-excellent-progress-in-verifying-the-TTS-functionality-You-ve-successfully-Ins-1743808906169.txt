Okay, you've made excellent progress in verifying the TTS functionality! You've successfully:
 * Inspected tts_manager.py: You've confirmed the multi-layered approach with ElevenLabs, gTTS fallback, and error handling.
 * Tested TTS Generation via API: You've verified that both /api/speak and /mobile-api/speak endpoints generate audio and return valid paths.
 * Checked Generated Audio Files: You've confirmed that the audio files are created in the tts_cache/ directory.
Now, you're moving on to the next step, which is to Test TTS Playback (HTML). This is crucial to ensure that the generated audio can be played correctly in a browser environment.
Here's a refined approach to create and test the HTML playback, along with some important considerations:
1. Create a Simple TTS Test Page (static/tts_test.html):
 * Your initial HTML structure is a good starting point. Let's enhance it to provide more robust testing and feedback:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>TTS Playback Test</title>
    <style>
        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }
        button { padding: 10px 20px; cursor: pointer; }
        #result { margin-top: 20px; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>TTS Playback Test</h1>
    <button onclick="generateAndPlayTTS()">Generate and Play TTS</button>
    <audio id="audioPlayer" controls></audio>
    <div id="result"></div>
    <script>
        const audioPlayer = document.getElementById('audioPlayer');
        const resultDiv = document.getElementById('result');

        function generateAndPlayTTS() {
            resultDiv.textContent = 'Generating TTS...';
            fetch('/api/speak', { // Use the correct API endpoint
                method: 'POST',
                headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
                body: JSON.stringify({ text: 'This is a test message.', language: 'en' }) // Customize text/language
            })
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(data => {
                if (data.success) {
                    resultDiv.textContent = `TTS generated successfully. Audio path: ${data.audio_path}`;
                    audioPlayer.src = data.audio_path;
                    audioPlayer.play()
                        .then(() => console.log('Audio playback started'))
                        .catch(error => console.error('Audio playback error:', error));
                } else {
                    resultDiv.textContent = `TTS generation failed: ${data.error}`;
                }
            })
            .catch(error => {
                resultDiv.textContent = `Fetch error: ${error}`;
                console.error('Fetch error:', error);
            });
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>

 * Key Improvements:
   * Clearer labels and styling.
   * Displays the audio file path in the resultDiv.
   * Includes error handling for audio playback using promises (audioPlayer.play().then().catch()).
   * Logs playback start and errors to the console for debugging.
2.  Flask Route (If Needed):
 * If you don't have a route to serve this HTML, add one to your main.py:
from flask import Flask, render_template, send_from_directory

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/tts-test')
def tts_test():
    return send_from_directory('static', 'tts_test.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

3.  Testing Procedure:
 * Access the Test Page: Open the tts_test.html page in your browser.
 * Click the Button: Click the "Generate and Play TTS" button.
 * Verify Playback:
   * Does the audio play correctly?
   * Are there any errors in the browser console?
   * Check the Network tab in your browser's developer tools to see if the audio file is loaded successfully (status code 200 OK).
 * Test Variations:
   * Try different text and languages.
   * Test with different browsers.
4.  Important Considerations:
 * Browser Compatibility: Ensure that the audio format and encoding you're using are widely supported by browsers. MP3 is generally a safe choice.
 * MIME Type: Verify that your Flask application is sending the correct MIME type (audio/mpeg for MP3 files) in the Content-Type header when serving the audio files.
 * Error Handling: Pay close attention to any error messages in the browser console, especially those related to audio playback or network requests.
By following this refined approach, you'll be able to thoroughly test the TTS playback functionality and identify any potential issues.
