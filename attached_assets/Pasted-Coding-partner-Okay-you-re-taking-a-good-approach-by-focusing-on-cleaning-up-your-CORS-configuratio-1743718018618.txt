Okay, you're taking a good approach by focusing on cleaning up your CORS configuration and creating a reliable test setup. Let's refine your strategy to ensure we're addressing the root cause of the web application accessibility issue.

Here's a breakdown of the situation and a structured plan:

1.  CORS Cleanup (As You've Started):

* **Consolidate CORS Handling:**
    * Remove any manual `@app.after_request` decorators or custom `OPTIONS` route handlers that you might have added to set CORS headers. `flask-cors` should handle these automatically.
    * Ensure that `flask-cors` is initialized *only once* in your `main.py` file.

* **Specific Origins:**
    * Replace any wildcard (`'*'`) in your `CORS` configuration with the *exact* origin(s) of the `web_application_feedback_tool`. This is crucial for security and often necessary for proper functionality.
    * If the feedback tool's origin is dynamic or complex, you might need to explore more advanced CORS configurations, but start with the most specific approach possible.

* **Methods and Headers:**
    * Carefully specify the allowed HTTP methods and headers in your `CORS` configuration. Only allow the methods and headers that your API endpoints actually use.
2.  Robust Test Setup (Crucial):

* **Minimal HTML Test Page:**
    * Creating a simple static HTML page is a good way to isolate whether the issue is with Flask routing or with serving static files.
    * However, let's make it more interactive to simulate the feedback tool's behavior:

        ```html
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <title>CORS Test Page</title>
            <script>
                function testCORS() {
                    fetch('/api/status')  // Replace with an actual API endpoint
                        .then(response => response.json())
                        .then(data => {
                            document.getElementById('result').textContent = 'Success: ' + JSON.stringify(data);
                        })
                        .catch(error => {
                            document.getElementById('result').textContent = 'CORS Error: ' + error;
                            console.error('Fetch error:', error);
                        });
                }
            </script>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>CORS Test Page</h1>
            <button onclick="testCORS()">Test CORS</button>
            <div id="result"></div>
        </body>
        </html>
        ```

    * This page includes a button that triggers a `fetch()` request to your API. The `fetch()` request is crucial to trigger CORS preflight requests and expose any header-related issues.
* **Flask Route for Test Page:**
    * Ensure that you have a Flask route that serves this `test.html` page (e.g., `/test-cors`).

* **Accessing the Test Page:**
    * **Manually:** Load the `test.html` page in your browser.
    * **Feedback Tool:** If possible, try to configure your `web_application_feedback_tool` to load this test page.
3.  Browser Developer Tools (The Key to Diagnosis):

* **Network Tab:** This is your primary debugging tool.
    * **Request Headers:** Examine the `Origin` header in the requests sent by the browser/feedback tool.
    * **Response Headers:** Look at the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in the responses. Does it match the `Origin`?
    * **Status Codes:** What are the HTTP status codes? (403 Forbidden, etc.)
    * **Console Errors:** Are there any CORS-related error messages in the browser console?
4.  Logging (Server-Side):

* Examine your server logs for any related errors or warnings.
Prioritized Action Plan:

Implement the Minimal HTML Test Page: This will help you isolate CORS issues.
Verify Manual Access: Make sure you can access the test page and your other application pages in a browser.
Browser Developer Tools (Crucial): Use the browser's developer tools to analyze network requests and responses.
Refine CORS Configuration: Based on the information from the developer tools, adjust your flask-cors settings.
Test with Feedback Tool: Finally, test with the web_application_feedback_tool.
