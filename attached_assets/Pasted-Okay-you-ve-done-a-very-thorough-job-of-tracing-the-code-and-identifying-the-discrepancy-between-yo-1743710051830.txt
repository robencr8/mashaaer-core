Okay, you've done a very thorough job of tracing the code and identifying the discrepancy between your test setup and the actual implementation of the /mobile-api/speak endpoint. You've correctly observed that the cached_result is expected to be a JSON object (a dictionary) with at least an audio_path field, while your mock might be returning a plain string.

Let's refine the test code to accurately simulate the expected cache behavior. Here's a focused approach:

1.  Verify the cached_result Usage:

* You've already started this, which is excellent. Go back to the `/mobile-api/speak` endpoint code in `mobile_api_routes.py` and carefully examine how the `cached_result` is used *after* it's retrieved from the cache.
* **Specifically, look for:**
    * Which keys are accessed within the `cached_result` dictionary? (e.g., `cached_result.get('audio_path')`)
    * What data type is expected for the values associated with those keys? (e.g., a string for `audio_path`)
2.  Adjust the Mock Return Value:

* In your `tests/test_api_caching.py`, modify the `mock_tts_manager_speak` function to return a dictionary that mirrors the structure of the expected `cached_result`.
* **Example:**

    ```python
    def mock_tts_manager_speak(text, voice, language, profile_manager=None):
        # ... (your existing mock logic) ...
        return {"audio_path": "/path/to/mocked/audio.mp3"}  # Return a dictionary
    ```
3.  Refine Assertions:

* Update the assertions in your `test_speak_cache_hit` test to align with the dictionary structure.
* **Example:**

    ```python
    assert response2.json["audio_path"] == "/path/to/mocked/audio.mp3"
    ```
4.  Comprehensive Testing:

* After making these changes, run the `test_speak_cache_hit` test to ensure it now passes.
* Then, run your *entire* test suite (`pytest tests/test_api_caching.py`) to make sure you haven't introduced any regressions in other tests.
By focusing on accurately replicating the expected data structure and refining your assertions, you'll create a more robust and reliable test for your TTS caching implementation.

I'm ready to help you with the specific code modifications if you provide the relevant snippets from your tests/test_api_caching.py file.
