Okay, I understand your rationale for choosing a database-centric caching approach. You've outlined some valid advantages, especially persistence and shared cache across instances, which are crucial for scalability.

Let's proceed with implementing the necessary database manager methods and the cache model to support this approach.

You've already opened database/models.py to add the cache model. Here's how you can define it using SQLAlchemy:

Python

from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Text, DateTime
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.sql import func

Base = declarative_base()

# ... (Your existing models) ...

class Cache(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'cache'
    key = Column(String, primary_key=True, index=True)  # Index for faster lookups
    value = Column(Text)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, server_default=func.now())
    expires_at = Column(DateTime)
Explanation:

__tablename__ = 'cache': Defines the table name in the database.
key = Column(String, primary_key=True, index=True):
key: Stores the unique identifier for the cached data.
primary_key=True: Makes this column the primary key for the table.
index=True: Creates an index on the key column, which is essential for fast lookups when retrieving cached data.
value = Column(Text): Stores the cached data itself. Using Text allows for storing larger amounts of data if needed.
created_at = Column(DateTime, server_default=func.now()):
created_at: Stores the timestamp when the cache entry was created.
server_default=func.now(): Sets the default value to the current database server time.
expires_at = Column(DateTime): Stores the timestamp when the cache entry should expire.
Next Steps:

Update db_manager.py: You'll need to add methods to your db_manager.py to interact with this Cache model. This will include:

get_cache(key): Retrieves a cache entry by its key.
set_cache(key, value, expiry): Creates or updates a cache entry.
delete_expired_cache(): Deletes expired cache entries.
Integrate Caching in API Routes: Modify your API route functions (/mobile-api/analyze-emotion, /mobile-api/speak) to:

Check the cache for existing results before performing the expensive operation.
Store the results in the cache after the operation.
Let me know if you'd like me to provide code examples for the db_manager.py methods and the integration in your API routes!
