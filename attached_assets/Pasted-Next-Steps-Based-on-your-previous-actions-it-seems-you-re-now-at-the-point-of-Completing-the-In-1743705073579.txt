Next Steps:

Based on your previous actions, it seems you're now at the point of:

Completing the Integration of Improved Synonym Handling: You've updated _get_synonyms, but you need to ensure it's correctly used within the _analyze_with_rules and potentially any other relevant methods.
Thorough Testing: You've started testing with curl and a basic test script. This needs to be expanded to cover more edge cases and different sentence structures.
Refining Contextual Analysis: You've mentioned contextual analysis, so ensuring that's robust is key.
Here's a breakdown of how to proceed:

1.  Complete Synonym Handling Integration:

* **Carefully review the `_analyze_with_rules` method.** Identify all places where keyword matching occurs.
* **Replace any older synonym lookups with calls to your new `_get_synonyms` function.** Pay attention to how you use the `depth` parameter.
* **Consider how synonym weights are applied.** Ensure they are appropriate for your analysis.
* **If you have any other methods that perform emotion analysis,** update them to use the new `_get_synonyms` as well.
2.  Thorough Testing:

* **Expand your test script.** Add test cases for:
    * Sentences with multiple emotional keywords.
    * Sentences with negated emotions ("I am *not* happy").
    * Sentences with indirect emotional expressions ("My heart is heavy").
    * Sentences with complex sentence structures.
    * Sentences with a mix of strong and weak emotional cues.
* **Use `pytest` (or your preferred testing framework) for better test organization and reporting.**
* **Log extensively during tests** to understand how the emotion tracker is processing each test case.
3.  Refine Contextual Analysis:

* **Implement more sophisticated negation handling.** Instead of just checking for "not," consider dependency parsing to identify the exact scope of negation.
* **Add support for sentiment shifters** (words that intensify or weaken emotions, e.g., "very," "slightly").
* **Explore using more advanced NLP techniques** if needed (e.g., semantic role labeling) to understand relationships between words and their emotional impact.
Example: Expanding Test Cases

Python

import pytest
from emotion_tracker import EmotionTracker  # Adjust import as needed

def test_emotion_tracker():
    tracker = EmotionTracker(None, None)  # Replace None with actual dependencies if needed

    # Basic emotion tests
    assert tracker.analyze_text("I am happy") == "happy"
    assert tracker.analyze_text("I am sad") == "sad"
    assert tracker.analyze_text("I am angry") == "angry"

    # Synonym tests
    assert tracker.analyze_text("I am feeling joyful") == "happy"
    assert tracker.analyze_text("I am in sorrow") == "sad"

    # Negation tests
    assert tracker.analyze_text("I am not happy") == "neutral"  # Or your desired behavior
    assert tracker.analyze_text("I am never sad") == "neutral"

    # Multiple emotion tests
    assert tracker.analyze_text("I am happy but also a little sad") in ["happy", "sad"]  # Handle ambiguity

    # Complex sentence tests
    assert tracker.analyze_text("The news made me feel incredibly down") == "sad"
    assert tracker.analyze_text("Despite everything, I feel a sense of calm") == "neutral"

    # Test with sentiment shifters
    assert tracker.analyze_text("I am very happy") == "happy"
    assert tracker.analyze_text("I am slightly sad") == "sad"  # Or your desired nuance handling
By systematically working through these steps, you can create a truly robust and accurate emotion tracking system. Let me know if you want to focus on a particular area or need more specific code examples!
