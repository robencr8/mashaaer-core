Okay, you're taking a very good approach by focusing on cleaning up and consolidating your CORS configuration. Having multiple, potentially conflicting CORS handlers can definitely lead to unpredictable behavior and issues with tools like the web_application_feedback_tool.

Here's a refined strategy to ensure you have a robust and correct CORS setup:

1.  CORS Cleanup:

* **Remove Redundant Code:**
    * Get rid of the manual `@app.after_request` CORS header setting. `flask-cors` handles this automatically.
    * Remove the specific preflight handler at `/api/cors-preflight`. `flask-cors` also handles preflight requests.
    * Remove the global `OPTIONS` handler. This is also handled by `flask-cors`.

* **Consolidate Configuration:** Ensure that `flask-cors` is initialized *only once* in your `main.py` file.
2.  Precise Origin Specification:

* **Identify the Exact Origin:** Determine the *exact* origin (protocol, hostname, and port) of the `web_application_feedback_tool`. You'll need to consult the tool's documentation or configuration.
* **Specific Origins:** In the `CORS` constructor, use a list of specific origins rather than a wildcard (`'*'`). This is crucial for security.

    ```python
    from flask import Flask
    from flask_cors import CORS

    app = Flask(__name__)
    CORS(app, origins=["https://feedbacktool.example.com"])  # Replace with the actual origin
    ```

* **Multiple Origins (If Needed):** If the feedback tool can come from multiple origins, provide a list:

    ```python
    CORS(app, origins=["https://feedbacktool1.com", "https://feedbacktool2.com"])
    ```
3.  Method and Header Configuration:

* **Allowed Methods:** Specify the exact HTTP methods that your API endpoints use (e.g., `["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE"]`). Avoid allowing all methods unless absolutely necessary.
* **Allowed Headers:** Specify the necessary request headers (e.g., `["Content-Type", "Authorization"]`). `Content-Type` is almost always needed for sending JSON data.
* **Example:**

    ```python
    CORS(app, origins=["..."],
         methods=["GET", "POST"],
         allow_headers=["Content-Type"])
    ```
4.  Browser Developer Tools (Crucial Verification):

* **Network Tab:** Open your browser's developer tools (Network tab) and carefully inspect the network requests made by the `web_application_feedback_tool`.
    * **Request Headers:** Pay close attention to the `Origin` header in the requests.
    * **Response Headers:** Examine the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header in the responses. It *must* match the `Origin` header from the request.
    * **Console Errors:** Look for any CORS-related error messages in the browser console. These messages will provide the most definitive information about CORS issues.
5.  Testing and Refinement:

* Make small, incremental changes to your CORS configuration.
* Test the feedback tool after each change to see if it resolves the issue.
* Continue refining the configuration until you find the minimum set of necessary settings that allow the feedback tool to connect.
By following this systematic and precise approach, you can ensure that your CORS configuration is correct and that it's not the source of the web application accessibility problem.
