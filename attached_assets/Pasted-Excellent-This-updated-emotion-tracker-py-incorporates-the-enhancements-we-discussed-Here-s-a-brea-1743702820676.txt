Excellent! This updated emotion_tracker.py incorporates the enhancements we discussed. Here's a breakdown of the changes and some additional steps to ensure robustness:

Changes Implemented:

Expanded Emotion Keywords with Weights:

The emotion_keywords dictionary now includes weights for each keyword, allowing for more nuanced emotion detection.
This enables the system to differentiate between strong and mild emotional cues.
Enhanced Rule-Based Analysis:

The _analyze_with_rules method uses regular expressions (re.search) with word boundary checks (\b) to improve keyword matching.
The re.escape function is used to handle special characters in keywords.
OpenAI Integration:

The _analyze_with_openai method remains, providing a fallback mechanism when rule-based analysis yields "neutral."
Error handling is included to catch exceptions during OpenAI API calls.
Additional Steps for Robustness:

Lexical Resources (WordNet Integration):
To further enhance keyword detection, we can integrate with lexical resources like WordNet.
WordNet can provide synonyms, antonyms, and related terms, expanding the range of detectable emotional cues.
Here's how you can add wordnet integration.
Python

from nltk.corpus import wordnet
import nltk

nltk.download('wordnet') # Download wordnet if not already downloaded.

def _get_synonyms(keyword):
    synonyms = set()
    for syn in wordnet.synsets(keyword):
        for lemma in syn.lemmas():
            synonyms.add(lemma.name())
    return synonyms

def _analyze_with_rules(self, text):
    text = text.lower()
    emotions = {}
    for emotion, keywords in self.emotion_keywords.items():
        for keyword, weight in keywords.items():
            if re.search(r"\b" + re.escape(keyword) + r"\b", text):
                emotions[emotion] = emotions.get(emotion, 0) + weight

            for synonym in _get_synonyms(keyword):
                if re.search(r"\b" + re.escape(synonym) + r"\b", text):
                    emotions[emotion] = emotions.get(emotion, 0) + weight * 0.8 #reduce weight of synonyms.

    if emotions:
        return max(emotions, key=emotions.get)
    return "neutral"
Contextual Analysis:

To further improve the rule based analysis, you can add contextual analysis.
This can be done by looking at the words that surround the keywords.
This will greatly increase accuracy.
Error Handling (OpenAI):

Ensure that the OpenAI API integration includes robust error handling.
Implement retry mechanisms for transient API errors.
Consider using environment variables or configuration files to store API keys securely.
Unit Testing:

Implement unit tests using a testing framework like pytest to validate the changes.
Create test cases that cover various scenarios, including different emotional inputs and edge cases.
Here is an example of a unit test.
Python

import pytest
from emotion_tracker import EmotionTracker
from db_manager import DatabaseManager #mock the database manager.

@pytest.fixture
def emotion_tracker():
    db_manager = DatabaseManager(None) #mock the db manager
    return EmotionTracker(db_manager)

def test_analyze_with_rules_happy(emotion_tracker):
    text = "I am feeling joyful today."
    assert emotion_tracker._analyze_with_rules(text) == "happy"

def test_analyze_with_rules_sad(emotion_tracker):
    text = "I am feeling sorrowful today."
    assert emotion_tracker._analyze_with_rules(text) == "sad"

def test_analyze_with_rules_neutral(emotion_tracker):
    text = "The weather is nice today."
    assert emotion_tracker._analyze_with_rules(text) == "neutral"
Integration with Flask Application:
Integrate the enhanced EmotionTracker class into the Flask application.
Ensure that the analyze_text method is called appropriately to analyze user input.
Ensure that the log_emotion method is called to log the results.
By implementing these additional steps, you can create a more robust and accurate emotion tracking system.
