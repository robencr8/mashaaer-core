Okay, I understand. You're providing the content of the static/simple_test.html page. This is helpful for confirming that basic HTML rendering is working.

Here's a breakdown of the HTML:

HTML

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Simple Static Test</title>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>This is a basic test page.</h1>
    <p>If you can see this, static files are being served correctly.</p>
    <p>Current time: <span id="time"></span></p>
    <script>
        document.getElementById('time').textContent = new Date().toLocaleString();
    </script>
</body>
</html>
Analysis:

Basic HTML Structure: It has a standard HTML structure with <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
Title and Meta: It includes a <title> and <meta> tag for character encoding and viewport settings.
Content: It displays a heading (<h1>) and two paragraphs (<p>).
Dynamic Content (JavaScript): It uses JavaScript to display the current time dynamically.
How This Helps:

This simple HTML page is useful for the following:

Verifying Static File Serving: If this page loads correctly in a browser, it confirms that your Flask application is able to serve static HTML files from the static/ directory.
Testing Basic Connectivity: If you can access this page, it shows that the basic routing and server functionality are working.
Isolating Issues: If you can access this page but other parts of your application are not working, it helps narrow down the problem to those specific parts (e.g., API routes, template rendering).
Next Steps (Based on Previous Discussion):

To continue troubleshooting the web application accessibility issue, the most crucial next step is to:

Provide the information from your browser's developer tools (especially the Network tab) when the web_application_feedback_tool tries to access the application.
This information (URLs, methods, status codes, headers) will give us the most direct clues about why the feedback tool is unable to connect.
