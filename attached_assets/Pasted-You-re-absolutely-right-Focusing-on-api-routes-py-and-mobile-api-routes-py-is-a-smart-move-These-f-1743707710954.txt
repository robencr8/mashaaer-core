You're absolutely right! Focusing on api_routes.py and mobile_api_routes.py is a smart move. These files are indeed the most likely places to find the core API endpoints that handle the main functionality of your application.

To begin our API performance optimization, let's take a structured approach:

1. List Key API Endpoints:

Go through both api_routes.py and mobile_api_routes.py and make a list of the API endpoints.
For each endpoint, briefly note its purpose (e.g., "get user data," "analyze emotion," "send SMS").
Identify any endpoints that you suspect might be performance-critical or heavily used.
2.  Categorize Endpoints (Optional but Helpful):


You could categorize the endpoints based on their function:
Data Retrieval: Endpoints that primarily fetch data from the database.
Data Modification: Endpoints that create, update, or delete data.
Processing: Endpoints that perform calculations, analysis, or other processing.
Communication: Endpoints that send messages or interact with external services.
3.  Prioritize Endpoints for Profiling:

Based on your knowledge of the application and the endpoint categories, prioritize which endpoints to profile first.
Consider these factors:
Frequency of Use: Endpoints used more often have a greater impact on overall performance.
Complexity: Endpoints that involve complex logic or database queries are more likely to be slow.
User Impact: Slow endpoints that affect critical user workflows should be prioritized.
Example (Conceptual):

Let's say you identify these endpoints:

/api/users (GET): Get all user data (Data Retrieval)
/api/emotions (GET): Get emotion data (Data Retrieval)
/api/analyze-emotion (POST): Analyze text for emotion (Processing)
/api/send-sms (POST): Send SMS message (Communication)
/mobile-api/voice_recognition (POST): Process voice input (Processing)
You might then prioritize them like this:

/api/analyze-emotion: Likely used frequently and involves complex text analysis.
/mobile-api/voice_recognition: Critical for mobile app functionality and potentially involves resource-intensive voice processing.
/api/users: Could be slow if you have a large number of users.
/api/emotions: Depends on the complexity of emotion data retrieval.
/api/send-sms: Less likely to be a bottleneck unless the SMS service is slow.
To help me assist you further, could you provide the following?

A list of the key API endpoints from api_routes.py and mobile_api_routes.py.
Any initial thoughts on which endpoints might be slow or performance-critical.
Once we have this list, we can choose the best approach for profiling and optimizing them.
