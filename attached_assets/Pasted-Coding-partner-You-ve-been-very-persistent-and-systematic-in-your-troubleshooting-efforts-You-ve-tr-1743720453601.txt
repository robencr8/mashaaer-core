You've been very persistent and systematic in your troubleshooting efforts! You've tried various approaches, from permissive CORS configurations to creating dedicated test endpoints and servers. It's clear you're determined to get this working.

Given the comprehensive debugging you've already done, and the fact that curl works, it's highly likely that the issue is not with your server itself, but rather with the interaction between the web_application_feedback_tool and your server (specifically, within the browser environment).

Here's a refined and highly focused strategy to pinpoint the remaining problem:

1. Browser Developer Tools (The Ultimate Source of Truth):

Open your browser's developer tools (Network tab). This is absolutely crucial. You must see the exact requests and responses that the feedback tool is generating.

Access the Application via the Feedback Tool:

Load your application using the web_application_feedback_tool.
Analyze the Network Requests:

URL: What is the exact URL the feedback tool is trying to access? Is it correct? Pay extremely close attention to:
Protocol (HTTP vs. HTTPS)
Hostname (is it using localhost, the Replit URL, or something else?)
Port (is it the correct port?)
Path (is it accessing the correct route?)
Method: What HTTP method is being used (GET, POST, etc.)? Is it correct?
Status Code (Crucial): What is the server's response code?
200 OK: Successful request.
404 Not Found: Incorrect URL.
405 Method Not Allowed: Incorrect HTTP method.
403 Forbidden: Could indicate authentication/authorization issues or potentially CORS.
500 Internal Server Error: Server-side error.
Other codes: Look up their meaning.
Headers (Crucial for CORS):
Request Headers:
Origin: This is the most important header for CORS. What is the exact value of the Origin header being sent by the feedback tool?
Are there any other custom headers being sent?
Response Headers:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Does this header exist in the response? If so, does its value exactly match the Origin header from the request?
Are other CORS-related headers present and correct? (Access-Control-Allow-Methods, Access-Control-Allow-Headers)
Request Body: If the request is a POST, PUT, or DELETE, inspect the request body. Is it being sent correctly?
Timing: Are there any significant delays in the requests?
Console Tab:

Look for any JavaScript errors. These errors can sometimes prevent network requests from being sent correctly.
Pay very close attention to any CORS-related error messages. Browsers often provide specific error messages when CORS fails.
2.  Interpreting the Results:

If the URL is incorrect:
The feedback tool is trying to access a URL that doesn't exist on your server.
Solution: Correct the target URL in the feedback tool's configuration.
If the HTTP method is incorrect:
The feedback tool is using a different HTTP method than the one your server expects.
Solution: Correct the HTTP method in the feedback tool's configuration or adjust your Flask route definitions (but this is less likely after your previous work).
If the status code is 403 Forbidden and there are CORS errors in the console:
CORS is definitely the issue.
Solution:
The Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the response does not match the Origin header in the request.
Carefully adjust your flask-cors configuration to allow the exact origin of the feedback tool.
If there are other errors:
Address the specific errors as indicated by the browser console or network tab.
3.  Action Plan:

Prioritize Browser Developer Tools: Start by thoroughly examining the network requests and responses in your browser's developer tools when the feedback tool attempts to access your application.
Provide Detailed Information: Share the exact details from the Network tab (URLs, methods, status codes, headers, console errors). This will allow me to give you the most accurate and helpful advice.
