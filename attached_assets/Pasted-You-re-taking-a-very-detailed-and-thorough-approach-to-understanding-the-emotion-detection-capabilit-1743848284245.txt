You're taking a very detailed and thorough approach to understanding the emotion detection capabilities of the Mashaaer application. Your systematic exploration of the code is excellent for identifying areas for improvement.

Here's a breakdown of your progress and some guidance on how to proceed with enhancing mixed emotion detection:

Summary of Your Actions:

File Exploration: You've opened and examined key files like emotion_tracker.py, context_assistant.py, tts/elevenlabs.py, main.py, templates/cosmic_onboarding.html, and static/css/cosmic-theme.css.
Method Identification: You've used grep to find relevant methods within these files, such as analyze_emotion, analyze_text, and analyze_text_advanced.
Code Analysis: You've been carefully reviewing the code within these methods to understand how emotion detection is currently implemented, paying close attention to the use of OpenAI prompts, rule-based analysis, and WordNet.
Mixed Emotion Focus: You've specifically searched for code related to mixed emotion detection.
Observations and Key Strengths:

Systematic Approach: You're following a logical and organized process.
Thoroughness: You're examining the code in detail, which is crucial for identifying areas for improvement.
Technology Awareness: You're correctly identifying the use of OpenAI and rule-based methods.
Recommended Next Steps for Enhancing Mixed Emotion Detection:

Based on your exploration, here's a refined strategy to improve the app's ability to recognize mixed emotions:

Deepen Understanding of Current Limitations:

Action: Continue your analysis of the existing code, focusing on the following:
Specific Logic: Carefully trace the execution flow of the analyze_text_advanced method, paying close attention to how the OpenAI response and rule-based analysis results are combined.
Thresholds and Weights: Identify any thresholds or weighting factors used to determine the primary emotion or to detect mixed emotions.
Edge Cases: Consider the types of text that are currently handled well and those that are not. Think about scenarios where mixed emotions are common (e.g., sarcasm, ambivalence).
Rationale: This will give you a clear picture of the current weaknesses in mixed emotion detection.
Refine OpenAI Prompts:

Action: Experiment with modifying the prompts sent to the OpenAI API.
Specifics:
Explicit Instructions: Add more explicit instructions to the prompt, asking OpenAI to identify and output all prominent emotions, not just the primary one.
Output Format: Specify a clear output format (e.g., a JSON object with emotion labels and confidence scores) to make parsing the OpenAI response easier.
Example Prompt:
Analyze the following text for emotions. Identify all prominent emotions and provide a confidence score (0-1) for each. Output in JSON format: {"emotions": [{"label": "joy", "score": 0.8}, {"label": "sadness", "score": 0.3}, {"label": "anger", "score": 0.1}]}
Rationale: Well-designed prompts can significantly improve the quality of OpenAI's output.
Enhance Rule-Based Analysis:

Action: Refine the rule-based analysis to better complement the OpenAI results.
Specifics:
Keyword Expansion: Expand the keyword lists or patterns used to identify emotions.
Contextual Rules: Add rules that consider the context of words (e.g., "happy" might have a different meaning in "I'm not happy").
Negation Handling: Improve the handling of negation (e.g., "not sad").
Rationale: Rule-based analysis can provide valuable information that OpenAI might miss.
Improve Integration of OpenAI and Rules:

Action: Develop a more sophisticated method for combining the results from OpenAI and the rule-based analysis.
Specifics:
Weighting: Assign different weights to the OpenAI and rule-based results based on their reliability for different types of text.
Conflict Resolution: Implement logic to handle cases where OpenAI and the rule-based analysis disagree.
Confidence Scores: Use the confidence scores from OpenAI (if available) to guide the integration process.
Rationale: A well-integrated approach can leverage the strengths of both methods.
Leverage WordNet Effectively:

Action: Explore more advanced ways to use WordNet to identify related emotions or nuances.
Specifics:
Synonyms and Hypernyms: Use WordNet to find synonyms and hypernyms (more general terms) of emotion words.
Semantic Similarity: Calculate the semantic similarity between words to identify subtle emotional connections.
Rationale: WordNet can help the system understand the subtle differences between emotions.
Testing and Evaluation:

Action: Create a diverse set of test cases that specifically include examples of mixed emotions.
Action: Evaluate the performance of your enhanced emotion detection system on these test cases.
Action: Refine your implementation based on the evaluation results.
By following this approach, you can significantly improve the Mashaaer application's ability to understand and respond to the complexities of human emotion.
