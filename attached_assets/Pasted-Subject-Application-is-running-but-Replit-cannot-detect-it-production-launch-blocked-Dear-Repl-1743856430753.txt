Subject: Application is running but Replit cannot detect it – production launch blocked

Dear Replit Support,

We are experiencing a critical issue with our application hosted on Replit. The app runs perfectly when tested locally via `curl` and the logs confirm that Gunicorn is binding correctly to 0.0.0.0:5000. However, Replit’s comment agent and deployment system are failing to detect that the server is up and running.

Here’s a breakdown of the situation:

✅ What works:
- The Flask app launches via Gunicorn
- `curl http://localhost:5000/` returns 200 OK
- `/health` and `/api/status` endpoints return valid JSON
- Sound and TTS APIs are functional
- Logs confirm incoming traffic and requests

❌ What’s broken:
- Replit’s UI and testing agent report that the app is not responding
- HTML and JS assets (like interactive_cosmic_splash.html) are not rendering in Replit's web preview
- It seems like Replit is not recognizing a valid HTTP 200 response from our root `/` route

🎯 Suspected causes:
- CORS config (`origins="*" and supports_credentials=True`) might be causing Replit's internal iframe check to fail
- Replit may be looking for a specific HTTP header or misconfigured health check logic
- Replit may not properly respect `main:app` when `.workflow` is being used instead of `.replit`

🔍 Reproduction:
1. Run the Flask app using Gunicorn as per the `.workflow`
2. Access via `curl` or browser: everything works
3. Replit's preview and comment system still fail

This is blocking a **live production demo** of an emotional AI assistant called **"Mashaaer | مشاعر"**. The experience involves:
- Voice and emotion recognition
- Real-time audio playback
- Interactive cosmic-themed UI
All systems are working except Replit's frontend routing or health check logic.

Please investigate and advise urgently. This is not a staging app — it’s the official launch interface, and this issue is causing a public delay.

Thank you for your support.
