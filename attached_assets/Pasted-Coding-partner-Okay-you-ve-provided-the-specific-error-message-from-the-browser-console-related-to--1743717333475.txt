Okay, you've provided the specific error message from the browser console related to audio playback:

DOMException {code: 9, name: "NotSupportedError", message: "Failed to load because no supported source was found."}
This error message is very informative and points us directly to the issue. It means the browser is unable to play the audio file because it doesn't recognize the file format or encoding.

Here's a refined approach to address this audio playback problem:

1.  Verify File Format and Encoding (Crucial):

* **Inspect Audio Files:** Use a tool like `ffprobe` (part of the `ffmpeg` suite) to get detailed information about the audio files in your `tts_cache/` directory.

    ```bash
    ffprobe tts_cache/your_audio_file.mp3
    ```

    * This will show you:
        * The audio codec used (e.g., `mp3`, `aac`).
        * The sample rate.
        * The bitrate.
        * Other relevant metadata.
* **Browser Compatibility:** Research which audio formats and encodings are widely supported across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
    * MP3 is generally well-supported, but specific encoding parameters can sometimes cause issues.
    * AAC is another popular format, but support varies.
    * WAV is often supported but results in larger file sizes.
2.  Re-encoding with ffmpeg (If Necessary):

* If `ffprobe` reveals that your audio files are in an incompatible format or encoding, use `ffmpeg` to re-encode them.
* The parameters you provided earlier are a good starting point:

    ```bash
    ffmpeg -y -i input.mp3 -acodec libmp3lame -ar 44100 -ab 192k output.mp3
    ```

    * `-y`: Overwrite output files without asking.
    * `-i input.mp3`: Specify the input file.
    * `-acodec libmp3lame`: Use the `libmp3lame` MP3 encoder (a good choice for compatibility).
    * `-ar 44100`: Set the sample rate to 44.1 kHz (a standard value).
    * `-ab 192k`: Set the audio bitrate to 192 kbps (a reasonable quality/size tradeoff).
    * `output.mp3`: Specify the output file.
* **Batch Processing:** You can create a script to re-encode all files in your `tts_cache/` directory.
3.  MIME Type (Double-Check):

* **Flask Configuration:** Ensure that your Flask application is sending the correct MIME type (`audio/mpeg` for MP3 files) in the `Content-Type` header when serving the audio files.
* You've already added routes for this. Double-check that they are working.
* **Browser Developer Tools:** Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the response headers of the audio file requests. Verify that the `Content-Type` is indeed `audio/mpeg`.
4.  Simplified Test:

* Create a minimal HTML page with a simple audio player to isolate the playback issue.
* Try playing both an original audio file and a re-encoded version in this test page.
* This will help you determine if the problem is related to the audio files themselves or to how they're being handled in your main application.
5.  Code Snippets (Illustrative):

* **Flask MIME Type Setting:**

    ```python
    from flask import Flask, send_file
    import os

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/audio/<filename>')
    def serve_audio(filename):
        return send_file(filename, mimetype='audio/mpeg')

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```

* **Minimal HTML Test Page:**

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Audio Test</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="test.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
By systematically working through these steps, you can identify and resolve the audio playback issues in your application. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance with any of these steps!
