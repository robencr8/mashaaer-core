Okay, you're taking a pragmatic approach by simplifying the update process using Python's string methods instead of complex regular expressions. This can be a good strategy when the replacements are relatively straightforward and you prioritize clarity and reliability over the power of regular expressions.

Here's a refined version of the update_api_calls_simple.py script, along with explanations and suggestions for further improvement:

Python

#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
Script to update fetch() calls in cosmic_onboarding.html to use POST method
instead of GET for the /api/listen-for-voice endpoint, using string methods.
"""
import sys
import logging

# Configure logging (optional but recommended)
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(levelname)s: %(message)s')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def update_fetch_calls(filepath: str) -> bool:
    """
    Updates fetch() calls in the given HTML file to use POST for /api/listen-for-voice.

    Args:
        filepath: The path to the HTML file.

    Returns:
        bool: True if updates were successful, False otherwise
    """

    try:
        with open(filepath, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            content = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        logger.error(f"File not found: {filepath}")
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error reading file {filepath}: {e}")
        return False

    # String to search for
    search_string = "fetch('/api/listen-for-voice?language="
    # String to replace with
    replace_string = """fetch('/api/listen-for-voice', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify({ language: """

    updated_content = content.replace(search_string, replace_string)

    # Check if any replacements were made
    if content == updated_content:
        logger.info(f"No matches found in {filepath}")
        return False

    # Replace the closing parenthesis
    updated_content = updated_content.replace("})", "})})")

    try:
        with open(filepath, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(updated_content)
        logger.info(f"Successfully updated fetch() calls in {filepath}")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error writing to file {filepath}: {e}")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python update_api_calls_simple.py <filepath>")
        sys.exit(1)

    filepath = sys.argv[1]

    if not update_fetch_calls(filepath):
        sys.exit(1)

    sys.exit(0)
Key Improvements and Considerations:

Argument Handling: The script now correctly handles command-line arguments to get the file path.
Clearer Variable Names: Using more descriptive variable names improves readability.
Error Handling: The script includes try...except blocks for file I/O operations.
Logging: The script uses the logging module for informative messages.
String Formatting: Using f-strings for string formatting is more concise.
Simplified Replacement: The script uses the .replace() method, which is simpler than regular expressions for this specific case.
Exit Codes: The script uses sys.exit() with appropriate exit codes to indicate success or failure.
How to Use the Script:

Save the script as update_api_calls_simple.py.

Make the script executable:

Bash

chmod +x update_api_calls_simple.py
Run the script, providing the file path as a command-line argument:

Bash

./update_api_calls_simple.py templates/cosmic_onboarding.html
Important:

Test with a Copy: Always test the script on a copy of your cosmic_onboarding.html file first to avoid accidental modifications.
Inspect the Output: Carefully examine the modified file to ensure the replacements were made correctly.
Browser Testing: After applying the changes, thoroughly test the cosmic_onboarding.html page in your browser, using the developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the API requests.
This simplified Python script should be more reliable and easier to understand for this specific task.
