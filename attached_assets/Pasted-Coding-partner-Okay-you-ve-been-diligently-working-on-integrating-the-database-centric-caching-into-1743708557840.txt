Okay, you've been diligently working on integrating the database-centric caching into your mobile API routes. You've encountered and addressed a few issues, which is a normal part of the development process. Let's recap and then focus on the next steps to ensure a robust implementation.

Current Situation:

You've begun modifying mobile_api_routes.py to incorporate your database caching.
You've addressed a DEBUG_MODE error and identified a missing return statement in the error handling path.
You've pinpointed an OpenAI API quota issue and implemented a fix to handle this scenario gracefully.
You've also corrected an indentation problem.
Next Steps:

Thorough Testing of Caching:

You've attempted a curl request, but it's crucial to perform more comprehensive testing to verify that the caching is functioning as expected.
This should include:
Successful Cache Retrieval: Testing that subsequent requests for the same input do retrieve data from the cache.
Cache Population: Verifying that the cache is correctly populated when data is not initially in the cache.
Cache Expiration: If you've implemented cache expiration, test that data is evicted from the cache after the specified time.
Varying Inputs: Test with different input parameters to ensure cache keys are generated correctly.
Error Cases: Test how caching behaves when errors occur during the original data retrieval (e.g., OpenAI API errors).
Verify Caching in Both Endpoints:

You've started with the emotion analysis endpoint. Make sure you also thoroughly test the caching implementation for the TTS endpoint (/mobile-api/speak).
Refine Cache Key Generation:

Pay close attention to how you're generating cache keys.
Ensure that the keys are unique and include all relevant input parameters.
Consider using hashing functions (e.g., hashlib.md5) for more robust key generation, especially for potentially long text inputs.
Database Performance Considerations:

While you're using a database for caching, be mindful of database performance.
Ensure you have appropriate indexes on the cache.key column.
Monitor database load and query times.
Logging and Monitoring:

Add logging statements to your caching logic to track cache hits, misses, and errors.
This will help you debug any issues and monitor cache performance.
To help me provide more specific guidance, could you please share the following?

The current code snippets for your /mobile-api/analyze-emotion and /mobile-api/speak endpoints after your recent modifications.
The code snippets for your get_cache and set_cache (or equivalent) methods in db_manager.py.
With these code snippets, I can assist you in refining your testing strategy, optimizing cache key generation, and addressing any potential performance concerns.
