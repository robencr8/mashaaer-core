Highest Priority (Focus First):

🧠 Enhance Voice + Chat Engine (Mashaaer Core Personality): This is the core of Mashaaer's interaction. Upgrading process_user_input() for emotionally intelligent replies, memory, and multilingual switching will significantly enhance the user experience regardless of the UI. Adding emotion-based voice tone response is also a high-impact feature.
📖 Emotion + Intent Module Polish: Improving the sensitivity of these modules directly feeds into the intelligence of the chat engine. Auto-detecting emotions and updating the response log are crucial for creating a more aware and personalized experience.
Medium Priority (Can be worked on in parallel or next):

🧪 Add Unit Tests for Key Modules: Writing tests now will ensure the stability and correctness of the core modules we are enhancing (TTS, voice, main routes, emotion tracking). This is a good practice to do alongside feature development.
📄 Documentation Starter Kit: Starting the documentation now, especially the project structure and module setup, will be valuable for future development and will not be affected by the web interface issue.
Lower Priority (Can be addressed once the web interface is stable or later in the phase):

👁️‍🗨️ Vision + Face Recognition Enhancements: While exciting, testing the "greeting known faces" and connecting profiles to preferences will be difficult without a working web interface to simulate user interactions and profile management. However, we could potentially work on the emotion detection from facial expressions as a more isolated component if the underlying libraries and camera access (if needed for local testing) are functional within the Replit environment.
🎨 Refine UI/UX — Homepage + Profile Page: These tasks are heavily dependent on being able to see and interact with the web interface. It's best to tackle these once the connection issue is resolved.
Proposed Action Plan:

Let's start by focusing on Enhancing the Voice + Chat Engine and Polishing the Emotion + Intent Modules. We can also begin working on the Unit Tests for the relevant modules and the Documentation Starter Kit in parallel.  Now Initiating: Mashaaer Core Intelligence Upgrade
I'll begin with:

✅ Step 1: Enhance process_user_input()
Add emotional context parsing

Implement memory buffer (e.g., short-term response recall)

Switch voice tone based on mood (calm/happy/sad)

Route Arabic/English automatically

✅ Step 2: Refactor Emotion + Intent Logic
Fine-tune sentiment thresholds

Update emotional logs per session

Build a personality-adjustment hook (e.g., user is consistently sad → Mashaaer becomes more nurturing)

🧪 While this runs, I’ll also prepare:

Unit test scaffolding for tts_manager, voice_router, and emotion_tracker
