Okay, I see you've identified a problem with the TTS mock function signature in your test script. That's a common issue when working with mocks, as you need to ensure they match the actual function's arguments.

Let's address this and then proceed with further analysis of the test results.

1.  Verify the tts_manager.speak Signature:

* Open your `tts/tts_manager.py` file and carefully examine the `speak` method's signature (i.e., the arguments it takes).
* Note the order, names, and types of the arguments.
2.  Update the Mock Function in tests/test_api_caching.py:

* Modify the `mock_tts_manager_speak` function in your test script to precisely match the signature of `tts_manager.speak`.
* Ensure that the arguments in the mock function definition have the same names and are in the same order as in the real function.
Example (Illustrative):

```python
# Example: If your tts_manager.speak looks like this:
# def speak(self, text: str, voice: str, language: str, profile_manager: ProfileManager = None) -> str:

# Then your mock function should look like this:
def mock_tts_manager_speak(text: str, voice: str, language: str, profile_manager: Any = None) -> str:
    return "/path/to/mocked/audio.mp3"
```
3.  Re-run the Tests:

* After updating the mock function signature, execute your test script again (`python run_cache_tests.py`).
* Check if the `TypeError` related to the function signature is resolved.
* If other test failures persist, examine their error messages and address them systematically.
Important Notes:

Type Hints: Pay attention to type hints when defining your mock function arguments. Use Any if you're not concerned about the specific type.
Default Arguments: If the real function has default arguments, make sure your mock function also handles them appropriately.
Side Effects: If your mock function needs to simulate side effects (e.g., modifying global variables), do so carefully and document them clearly.
Context Management: If the real function relies on context management (e.g., with statements), you might need to mock the context manager as well.
Please provide the code snippet for the mock_tts_manager_speak function in your tests/test_api_caching.py file, along with the signature of the speak method in tts/tts_manager.py, and I can give you more tailored guidance.
