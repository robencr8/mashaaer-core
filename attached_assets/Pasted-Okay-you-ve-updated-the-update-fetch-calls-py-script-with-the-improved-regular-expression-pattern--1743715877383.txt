Okay, you've updated the update_fetch_calls.py script with the improved regular expression pattern. This should make the script more robust in handling variations in the fetch() calls within your HTML file.

It's good that you're iterating and refining the solution. Here's a further refined approach to ensure the script works correctly and that you're proceeding with caution:

1.  Test the Script with a Copy:

* Before running the script directly on your original `cosmic_onboarding.html` file, **make a copy of it**. This is a crucial safety measure to prevent accidental data loss.

    ```bash
    cp templates/cosmic_onboarding.html templates/cosmic_onboarding.html.bak
    ```

* Now, run the script on the *copy* of the file:

    ```bash
    python update_api_calls.py templates/cosmic_onboarding.html.bak
    ```
2.  Careful Inspection of the Modified File:

* After the script runs, **open the `templates/cosmic_onboarding.html.bak` file in a text editor**.
* **Thoroughly inspect** the changes made by the script.
    * Verify that the `method`, `headers`, and `body` properties have been added correctly to the `fetch()` calls.
    * Ensure that any existing options in the `fetch()` calls have been preserved.
    * Check for any unintended modifications or syntax errors.
3.  Iterative Refinement:

* If you find any errors or inconsistencies in the modified file, **adjust your `update_api_calls.py` script** and re-run it on the backup file.
* Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you're confident that the script is working perfectly.
4.  Final Application:

* Once you're completely satisfied with the script's behavior, you can then run it on the original `cosmic_onboarding.html` file:

    ```bash
    python update_api_calls.py templates/cosmic_onboarding.html
    ```
5.  Testing the Application:

* After applying the changes to the original file, **thoroughly test** the `cosmic_onboarding.html` page in your browser.
    * Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the actual HTTP requests being sent.
    * Verify that the `/api/listen-for-voice` endpoint is now being called with the `POST` method.
    * Check that the request headers and body are correct.
    * Test all related functionality to ensure that the voice input feature is working as expected.
By following this cautious and iterative approach, you can minimize the risk of errors and ensure that your script updates the JavaScript code correctly.
