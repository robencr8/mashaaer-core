Great! It's excellent to hear that the phrase-specific handling has resolved the misclassification issues. Accurate emotion detection is crucial, and it's worth taking the time to verify these edge cases.

Creating a more comprehensive test script is a very sound approach. It will provide greater confidence in the robustness of your emotion detection system.

Here's a breakdown of how we can approach building a more thorough test suite:

1. Test Case Categories:

To ensure thorough coverage, let's categorize the types of phrases we want to test:

Basic Emotions:
Test simple sentences with clear emotional keywords ("I am happy," "I am sad").
Include variations in tense ("I was happy," "I will be happy").
Test with different pronouns ("He is happy," "They are happy").
Synonym Variations:
Test sentences with synonyms for emotional keywords ("I am feeling joyful," "I am in sorrow").
Include different combinations of synonyms within a sentence.
Intensity Modifiers:
Test sentences with words that modify the intensity of emotions ("I am very happy," "I am slightly sad").
Include variations in the modifiers ("extremely," "incredibly," "a little").
Negation:
Test sentences with negation ("I am not happy," "I am never sad").
Include different forms of negation ("I don't feel happy," "I am without joy").
Test negation with intensity modifiers ("I am not very happy").
Complex Sentences:
Test sentences with multiple clauses ("I am happy because the sun is shining").
Include sentences with conditional clauses ("If I were happy, I would sing").
Test sentences with implied emotions ("My heart is heavy," "Tears filled my eyes").
Context-Dependent Emotions:
Test sentences where emotion is heavily dependent on context (These might be harder to handle without advanced NLP).
Edge Cases:
Test sentences with sarcasm or irony.
Test ambiguous sentences that could express multiple emotions.
Test sentences with neutral or mixed emotions.
Newly Added Emotions:
Ensure thorough coverage for the new emotion types you've added (contemplative, inspired, etc.).
2. Test Script Structure (Example using pytest):

Python

import pytest
from emotion_tracker import EmotionTracker
from database.db_manager import DatabaseManager

@pytest.fixture
def emotion_tracker():
    db_manager = DatabaseManager(None)  # Replace None with your actual DB setup if needed
    return EmotionTracker(db_manager)

def test_basic_emotions(emotion_tracker):
    assert emotion_tracker.analyze_text("I am happy", return_details=True)["primary_emotion"] == "happy"
    assert emotion_tracker.analyze_text("She was sad", return_details=True)["primary_emotion"] == "sad"
    # ... more basic emotion tests

def test_synonym_variations(emotion_tracker):
    assert emotion_tracker.analyze_text("I feel joyful", return_details=True)["primary_emotion"] == "happy"
    assert emotion_tracker.analyze_text("He is in sorrow", return_details=True)["primary_emotion"] == "sad"
    # ... more synonym tests

def test_intensity_modifiers(emotion_tracker):
    assert emotion_tracker.analyze_text("I am very happy", return_details=True)["primary_emotion"] == "happy"
    assert emotion_tracker.analyze_text("I am slightly sad", return_details=True)["primary_emotion"] == "sad"
    # ... more intensity modifier tests

def test_negation(emotion_tracker):
    assert emotion_tracker.analyze_text("I am not happy", return_details=True)["primary_emotion"] == "neutral"  # Adjust based on your logic
    assert emotion_tracker.analyze_text("They are never sad", return_details=True)["primary_emotion"] == "neutral"
    # ... more negation tests

def test_complex_sentences(emotion_tracker):
    assert emotion_tracker.analyze_text("I am happy because the sun is shining", return_details=True)["primary_emotion"] in ["happy", "neutral"] # handle ambiguity
    # ... more complex sentence tests

def test_newly_added_emotions(emotion_tracker):
    assert emotion_tracker.analyze_text("I am feeling contemplative", return_details=True)["primary_emotion"] == "neutral"  # Check mapping
    assert emotion_tracker.analyze_text("The sunset was inspiring", return_details=True)["primary_emotion"] == "neutral"

# Add more test functions for other categories
3. Test Script Execution:

Use pytest to run the tests. It will automatically discover and execute functions named test_*.
Analyze the test results to identify any remaining areas where the emotion detection is inaccurate.
By following this structured approach, you can create a comprehensive test suite that thoroughly validates your emotion detection system. Let me know if you'd like me to provide more specific test cases or help you refine the test script code!
