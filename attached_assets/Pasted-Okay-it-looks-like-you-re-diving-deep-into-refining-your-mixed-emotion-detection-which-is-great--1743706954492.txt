Okay, it looks like you're diving deep into refining your mixed emotion detection, which is great!  You've identified a specific misclassification ("bittersweet feeling of graduating" being classified as "fearful" instead of "mixed") and are taking a pattern-based approach to address it.

Here's a breakdown of how to approach this effectively and some suggestions to make your solution more robust:

1. Analyze the Problem Phrase:

"The bittersweet feeling of graduating - proud or sad..."
Key Observations:
"bittersweet" is the central clue. It strongly suggests a mix of "happy" (proud) and "sad."
The phrase explicitly mentions "proud or sad," further confirming the mix.
The "-" (dash) acts as a separator, highlighting the contrasting emotions.
2. Refine Your Mixed Emotion Detection Logic:

Pattern-Based Approach: Your decision to use pattern-based matching is good for this specific case. However, be cautious about over-specializing.

More Robust Pattern: Instead of just checking for "bittersweet," consider a pattern that also captures the "proud or sad" context.

Example (Conceptual):

Python

def _analyze_with_rules(self, text: str) -> Union[str, List[Tuple[str, float]]]:
    # ... (existing code) ...

    if re.search(r"\bbittersweet\b", text) and re.search(r"\b(proud|happy)\b.*\b(sad|grief)\b", text):
        emotions["happy"] += 2.0
        emotions["sad"] += 2.0
        emotions["mixed"] += 4.0
    elif re.search(r"\bexcited\b", text) and re.search(r"\bnervous\b", text):
        emotions["happy"] += 3.0  # excited maps to happy
        emotions["fearful"] += 3.0  # nervous maps to fearful
        emotions["mixed"] += 6.0
    # ... (other mixed emotion patterns) ...

    # ... (existing emotion determination logic) ...
Explanation:
We check for "bittersweet" AND a combination of "proud" or "happy" with "sad" or "grief."
This makes the rule more specific and less likely to misfire on other sentences.
The .* allows for words to come between the happy/sad indicators.
Contextual Clues (Beyond Conjunctions):

You can expand the "context cues" to include other words that indicate contrast or combination (e.g., "both," "and yet," "a blend of").
However, this can quickly become complex.
3. Test Thoroughly:

Specific Tests: Add a new test case to your test_expanded_phrases.py that specifically covers this "bittersweet graduating" scenario.
Variations: Consider testing variations of the phrase to ensure your pattern is robust (e.g., "a bittersweet feeling," "I felt bittersweet").
Regression: Re-run your entire test suite to make sure your new rule hasn't negatively impacted other classifications.
4. Long-Term Strategy:

Machine Learning: While pattern-based rules are useful for specific cases, they can be brittle. For truly robust mixed emotion detection, consider using machine learning models trained on data that explicitly labels mixed emotions.
Sentiment Analysis Libraries: Libraries like NLTK or TextBlob might offer some support for detecting mixed sentiment, which is related to mixed emotions.
Transformer Models (BERT, etc.): These advanced language models excel at understanding context and nuance, and they are state-of-the-art for sentiment analysis and emotion detection. They can often handle mixed emotions more effectively.
Before you implement the code, please provide the exact code you're planning to add to emotion_tracker.py so I can give you more specific feedback.
