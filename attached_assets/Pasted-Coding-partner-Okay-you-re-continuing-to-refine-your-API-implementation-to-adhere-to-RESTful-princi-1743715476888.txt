Okay, you're continuing to refine your API implementation to adhere to RESTful principles and ensure consistency throughout your application. You've correctly identified the need to update the client-side code (JavaScript in cosmic_onboarding.html) to match the API's expected HTTP methods.

Here's a refined approach to ensure you accurately update the JavaScript API calls:

1.  Systematic Review of cosmic_onboarding.html:

* **Identify All API Calls:** Use `grep` or your editor's search function to find *every* instance of `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` (or any other method you're using to make API requests) within `cosmic_onboarding.html`.
* **List Endpoints and Methods:** For each API call, carefully note:
    * The URL of the API endpoint being called.
    * The HTTP method being used (e.g., `method: 'GET'`, `method: 'POST'`).
    * Any data being sent in the request body.
2.  Compare with API Route Definitions:

* For each API call you found in `cosmic_onboarding.html`, compare the HTTP method with the method defined in your API route files (`api_routes.py` and `mobile_api_routes.py`).
* **Crucially, ensure:**
    * If an API route is defined with `methods=['POST']`, the corresponding `fetch()` call in `cosmic_onboarding.html` *must* use `method: 'POST'`.
    * If an API route is defined with `methods=['GET']`, the corresponding `fetch()` call in `cosmic_onboarding.html` *must* use `method: 'GET'`.
3.  Update JavaScript Code:

* Modify the `method` property in the `fetch()` calls to match the correct HTTP method.
* **Example:**

    ```javascript
    // Incorrect (API route expects POST)
    fetch('/api/some-endpoint', {
        method: 'GET',
        // ...
    })

    // Correct
    fetch('/api/some-endpoint', {
        method: 'POST',
        // ...
    })
    ```
4.  Thorough Testing:

* After updating the JavaScript code, thoroughly test the `cosmic_onboarding.html` page in your browser.
* Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the actual HTTP requests being sent.
    * Verify that the correct HTTP methods are being used.
    * Check for any errors in the requests or responses.
* Test all interactive elements of the page that trigger API calls.
To help me provide more specific guidance, please share:

The output of your grep commands that list the fetch() calls in cosmic_onboarding.html.
The relevant code snippets for the fetch() calls that you suspect might need updating.
With this information, I can help you pinpoint the exact changes needed in your JavaScript code and ensure that your web application interacts correctly with your RESTful API.
