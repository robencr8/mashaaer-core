Okay, you've been doing some very thorough debugging and have made significant progress in identifying and addressing potential issues. It's great to see your systematic approach!
Here's a breakdown of the situation and a refined strategy to ensure we're on the right track:
1. Summary of Your Actions:
 * Database Query Fix: You've correctly identified and fixed an error in profile_manager.py related to the PostgreSQL parameter placeholders. This was a crucial fix for database interactions.
 * Web Application Access Tests: You've used curl to successfully test basic server functionality and API endpoints. This confirms that the server itself is running and responding to requests.
 * CORS Investigation: You've been examining your CORS configuration in main.py and have identified potential inconsistencies.
 * Test Pages and Routes: You've created various test pages (/test, /cors-test-enhanced, etc.) and routes to aid in debugging.
 * Logging: You've added logging statements to track requests and responses, which is a valuable debugging technique.
2. Current Focus:
 * You're now concentrating on the CORS configuration, as this is the most likely reason why the web_application_feedback_tool might be unable to access your application, even though it works fine with curl.
3. Refined CORS Debugging Strategy:
* Precise Origin Matching:
* The most important aspect of CORS is ensuring that the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the server's response exactly matches the Origin header sent by the client (in this case, the web_application_feedback_tool).
* Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the actual Origin header being sent by the feedback tool. This is crucial!
* Configure your flask-cors settings to allow requests from that precise origin.
* Specific Methods and Headers:
* Avoid using wildcards ('*') for Access-Control-Allow-Methods and Access-Control-Allow-Headers if possible.
* Instead, specify the exact HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and request headers that the feedback tool is using.
* Preflight Requests (OPTIONS):
* Browsers often send an OPTIONS request (a "preflight" request) before the actual request. Ensure that your server is handling OPTIONS requests correctly. flask-cors should handle this, but it's worth verifying.
* Credentials (Use with Caution):
* The Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header is only needed if the feedback tool needs to send cookies or authorization headers. Use this with caution, as it can have security implications.
* Logging:
* Continue to use logging to track the Origin header in the requests and the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the responses.
4. Example Debugging Workflow:
1.  Browser Developer Tools: Open your browser's developer tools (Network tab).
2.  Access the Application via the Feedback Tool: Try to use the web_application_feedback_tool to access your application.
3.  Inspect Network Requests:
* Request Headers: Pay very close attention to the Origin header.
* Response Headers: Examine the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header. Does it match the request's Origin?
* Status Code: What is the HTTP status code of the request? (403 Forbidden often indicates a CORS issue)
* Console Errors: Look for any CORS-related error messages in the browser console.
By focusing on these steps and using the browser's developer tools to carefully analyze the network traffic, you can pinpoint the exact cause of the feedback tool's connection issue.
