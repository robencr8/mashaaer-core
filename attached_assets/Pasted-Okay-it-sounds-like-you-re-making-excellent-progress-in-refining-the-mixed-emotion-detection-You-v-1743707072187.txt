Okay, it sounds like you're making excellent progress in refining the mixed emotion detection. You've identified a persistent misclassification issue with the "excited but nervous" phrase and are focusing on improving the logic to handle this specific case.

You're also being methodical by:

Examining the Test Results: You're carefully analyzing the output of your test script to understand the exact nature of the misclassification.
Targeted Code Changes:

 You're focusing on modifying the emotion_tracker.py file to address the identified problem.
Iterative Testing: You're running the test script repeatedly to verify that your changes have the desired effect.
To help you further, let's focus on the following:

1.  Review the Existing Mixed Emotion Logic:

* Carefully examine the code you've already added to `emotion_tracker.py` to detect mixed emotions.
* Pay close attention to:
    * The specific patterns you're matching (regular expressions or keyword checks).
    * The weights you're assigning to individual emotions and the "mixed" emotion.
    * The conditions under which you decide to classify the emotion as "mixed."
2.  Analyze the Misclassification in Detail:

* **"While I am excited about the new project, I am also nervous..."**
* Why is "fearful" being incorrectly assigned?
    * Are the "nervous" keywords being weighted too heavily?
    * Is the "excited" keyword not being weighted enough?
    * Is there a conflict between the general emotion detection and the specific mixed emotion rule?
* Is the "While...also" construction not being properly considered?
3.  Refine the Mixed Emotion Rule:

* Based on your analysis, adjust your code in `emotion_tracker.py`.
* Consider:
    * **Adjusting Weights:** Experiment with different weights for "excited," "nervous," "happy," "fearful," and "mixed."
    * **More Precise Matching:** Refine your regular expressions to be more specific to the context (e.g., matching "excited" *and* "nervous" within a certain proximity).
    * **Contextual Clues:** If needed, add checks for words like "while," "but," "although," or "and yet" to strengthen the mixed emotion detection.
    * **Order of Operations:** Ensure that your mixed emotion rule is applied *before* the final dominant emotion is determined.
4.  Test Thoroughly:

* Run your test script after each change to `emotion_tracker.py`.
* Add more test cases that are similar to the problematic phrase but with slight variations (e.g., "I'm excited but a bit nervous," "Although excited, I'm nervous").
* Also, test cases with *other* mixed emotions to ensure your changes haven't introduced regressions.
To help me provide more specific guidance, please share the following:

The exact code snippet you're currently using in emotion_tracker.py to detect the "excited and nervous" mixed emotion.
The output of the full test run (as you mentioned you're going to provide).
With this information, I can help you fine-tune your mixed emotion detection logic and ensure accurate results.
