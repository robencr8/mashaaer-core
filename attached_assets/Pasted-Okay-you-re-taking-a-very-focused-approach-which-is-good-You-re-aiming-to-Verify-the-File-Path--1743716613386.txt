Okay, you're taking a very focused approach, which is good. You're aiming to:

Verify the File Path: You're checking if cosmic_onboarding.html exists in the root directory.
Inspect Line 994: You're specifically reviewing the fetch() call on line 994.
Here's a refined strategy to ensure you're making the correct changes and avoiding errors:

1.  File Path Verification:

* You've used `ls -la cosmic_onboarding.html`. This is a good start. However, to be more robust, use Python's `os.path.exists()`:

    ```python
    import os

    if os.path.exists("cosmic_onboarding.html"):
        print("cosmic_onboarding.html exists in the root directory")
    elif os.path.exists("templates/cosmic_onboarding.html"):
        print("cosmic_onboarding.html exists in the templates directory")
    else:
        print("cosmic_onboarding.html not found!")
        # Handle this error appropriately (e.g., exit the script)
    ```

* This is more reliable than relying on the output of `ls`.
2.  Read the File Content:

* Use Python's `open()` function to read the content of the `cosmic_onboarding.html` file:

    ```python
    try:
        with open("cosmic_onboarding.html", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            content = f.read()
    except FileNotFoundError:
        with open("templates/cosmic_onboarding.html", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            content = f.read()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading file: {e}")
        # Handle the error (e.g., exit the script)
    ```

* This ensures you're working with the actual file content in your Python script.
3.  Precise Replacement (Using Python's re Module):

* Instead of relying solely on `sed` or simple string replacement, use Python's `re` module for more robust and accurate regular expression matching and substitution.
* **Example:**

    ```python
    import re

    # Assuming 'content' holds the file content
    pattern = re.compile(
        r"""
        (fetch\(\s*['"]\/api\/listen-for-voice\?language=.*['"]\s*\+\s*selectedLanguage\s*\))  # Capture the original call
        """, re.VERBOSE | re.IGNORECASE
    )

    replacement = r"""
    fetch('/api/listen-for-voice', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ language: selectedLanguage })
    })
    """

    updated_content = re.sub(pattern, replacement, content)
    ```

* **Explanation:**
    * `re.compile()`: Compiles the regular expression for efficiency.
    * `r"""..."""`: Uses a raw string to avoid escaping backslashes.
    * The pattern captures the original `fetch()` call.
    * The `replacement` string constructs the new `fetch()` call with the correct `method`, `headers`, and `body`.
    * `re.sub()`: Performs the substitution.
4.  Write the Modified Content Back:

* Use Python's `open()` and `write()` to write the `updated_content` back to the file:

    ```python
    try:
        with open("cosmic_onboarding.html", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            f.write(updated_content)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        with open("templates/cosmic_onboarding.html", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            f.write(updated_content)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error writing to file: {e}")
        # Handle the error
    ```
5.  Thorough Testing:

* After running the script, carefully inspect the `cosmic_onboarding.html` file in a text editor to confirm the changes.
* Test the voice input functionality in your web application to ensure it's working correctly.
* Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the network requests and verify the HTTP method and data being sent.
This Python-based approach offers more control, readability, and error handling compared to using sed. It will also make your code more portable and less dependent on specific shell commands.
