Hello Replit Agent,

This is a final and urgent message regarding the production build of the Mashaaer emotional intelligence assistant.

After weeks of collaborative development, the current live version is not aligned with the experience we‚Äôve agreed on, neither visually nor functionally. Below is a consolidated list of issues, required fixes, and features that must be fully implemented before public demonstration.

---

‚úÖ 1. Interface Activation:
- The central cosmic sphere is the **only** trigger for interaction.
- Remove any external ‚ÄúStart‚Äù or ‚ÄúSay Hello‚Äù buttons.
- On click:
   - Play `/static/sounds/welcome.mp3`
   - Start voice recognition (via `VoiceRecognition`)
   - Fallback to text input if mic access fails

---

‚úÖ 2. Real-Time Sphere Feedback:
- While listening, the sphere should:
   - Pulse softly
   - Emit animated ripple rings
- After receiving input, sphere color must update to reflect emotion.
- Emotion-to-color mapping is **suggested only** (you have freedom to fine-tune for style):

| Emotion    | Suggested Color |
|------------|------------------|
| happy      | `#fcd34d` (soft yellow)  
| calm       | `#60a5fa` (sky blue)  
| angry      | `#ef4444` (deep red)  
| anxious    | `#fb923c` (warm orange)  
| sad        | `#a78bfa` (muted purple)  
| neutral    | `#9333ea` (default violet)

Smooth transitions and light glows are expected ‚Äî no harsh visual jumps.

‚úÖ 3. Emotional Response:
- After emotion is processed, the app should reply using TTS:
   - Use endpoint `/api/tts?text=...`
   - Play audio reply back to the user (via `speakText()`)

---

‚úÖ 4. Critical Regression: Cosmic Background Removed ‚ùå
- The moving star field / meteor background was removed ‚Äî this is unacceptable.
- You must **restore the full animated cosmic background** behind the sphere:
   - Animated stars, particle effects, or meteor shower
   - Possibly referenced via `meteor-shower.css`, `stars.js`, or `canvas` layers
- This background is part of the **branding** and the immersive user experience.

---

‚úÖ 5. File Consistency:
- Ensure these files are present and accessible:
   - HTML: `interactive_cosmic_splash.html` or `startup_standalone.html`
   - Sounds in: `static/sounds/` or `static/audio/` with files like:
     - `welcome.mp3`, `cosmic.mp3`, `click.mp3`, `listen_start.mp3`

---

‚úÖ 6. Clean UI:
- Keep the layout minimal:
   - Language toggle (AR/EN)
   - Cosmic sphere with glow & animation
   - Optional subtitle or message bubble
- Remove: test pages, developer placeholders, or redundant text

---

üéØ Final Goal:
Mashaaer is an emotional intelligence assistant, not a standard app. The UI, audio, and behavior must feel polished, alive, and emotionally responsive.

Please deploy the corrected version and confirm when live.
