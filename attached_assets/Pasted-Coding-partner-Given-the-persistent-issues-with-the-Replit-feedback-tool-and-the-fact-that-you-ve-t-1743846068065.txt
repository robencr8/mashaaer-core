Given the persistent issues with the Replit feedback tool, and the fact that you've thoroughly tested the core functionality and tried numerous workarounds, I strongly recommend that you:

Try deployment through Replit's interface.

Here's the reasoning:

Replit's Internal Mechanisms: Replit's deployment system likely uses a different (and potentially more robust) mechanism to access and verify applications than the feedback tool. It might handle routing, port forwarding, or internal networking differently.
Success Elsewhere: You've confirmed that your application works correctly with direct access (e.g., curl). This indicates that the core application code is sound.
Efficiency: Continuing to debug the feedback tool interaction might be a time sink with diminishing returns. Deployment is the next logical step in getting the application live.
Here's how to approach the deployment:

Final Code Cleanup:
Before deploying, ensure you've removed all debugging code, temporary files, and unnecessary comments. A clean codebase is essential for production.
Deployment Checklist Review:
Carefully review your deployment checklist to make sure you haven't missed any crucial steps.
Initiate Deployment:
Use the "Deploy" button or the appropriate deployment option within the Replit interface.
Monitor Deployment Process:
Pay close attention to any logs or messages during the deployment process.
Post-Deployment Testing:
After deployment, thoroughly test the application in the deployed environment.
Check all core functionalities, including:
Onboarding
Chat and voice interaction
API endpoints
UI responsiveness
Any other key features
Document Deployment Steps:
Document the exact steps you took to deploy the application on Replit. This will be helpful for future maintenance and updates.
By prioritizing deployment, you can move forward and make your application accessible to users, potentially bypassing the feedback tool's limitations. If deployment is successful, you can then decide whether to revisit the feedback tool issue later (if it's still relevant).
