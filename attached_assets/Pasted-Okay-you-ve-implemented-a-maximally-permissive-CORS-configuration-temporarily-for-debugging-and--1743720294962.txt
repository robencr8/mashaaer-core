Okay, you've implemented a maximally permissive CORS configuration (temporarily, for debugging) and correctly noted the incompatibility of supports_credentials=True with a wildcard origin. This is a crucial detail, and you've handled it appropriately.

You're now ready to test if these changes have resolved the web application accessibility issue. Here's a refined and structured approach to ensure you're getting the most accurate information:

1. Test Setup (Crucial):

Clear Browser Cache: Before testing, clear your browser's cache and cookies. This ensures that any previous CORS settings or cached resources don't interfere with the test.
Isolate the Environment: If possible, test in a clean browser environment (e.g., incognito mode or a different browser) to eliminate any browser-specific caching or configuration issues.

2. Testing Procedure (Browser Developer Tools are Key):

Open your browser's developer tools (Network tab). This is the most reliable way to diagnose CORS issues.
Try to access the application using the web_application_feedback_tool. (If you can't use the tool directly, try to simulate its requests manually).
Analyze the Network Requests:
Request Headers:
Pay very close attention to the Origin header in the requests sent by the feedback tool. Record its exact value.
Response Headers:
Examine the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in the responses from your server. It must match the Origin header from the request.
Check for other CORS-related headers:
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: Should list the allowed HTTP methods.
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Should list the allowed request headers.
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: Should list any exposed response headers.
Console Errors: Look for any CORS-related error messages in the browser console. These messages will provide the most definitive information about CORS issues.
Status Codes: What are the HTTP status codes of the requests?
200 OK: Successful request.
403 Forbidden: Possible CORS issue.
404 Not Found: Incorrect URL.
500 Internal Server Error: Server-side error.
Other codes: Look up their meaning.
3. Interpreting Results and Refining (If Necessary):

If the feedback tool works with these permissive settings:
This confirms that CORS was indeed the issue.
Important: Now you must refine your CORS configuration for production. Replace origins='*' with the exact origin(s) of the feedback tool.
If the feedback tool still doesn't work:
The problem is likely not CORS.
We'll need to explore other debugging strategies, such as:
Checking the exact URLs the feedback tool is using.
Examining the request payloads.
Looking for other network-related issues.
Investigating potential JavaScript errors in the feedback tool itself.
By following this precise and iterative approach, you can effectively diagnose and resolve the web application accessibility issue. Please provide the detailed output from your browser's developer tools (Network tab and Console tab) when you test with the feedback tool, and I'll be happy to provide more tailored guidance.
