Okay, you've narrowed down the web application accessibility issue. You've confirmed that the server is running and API endpoints are working, but accessing the cosmic_onboarding.html page directly is failing.

You're now investigating how the cosmic_onboarding.html page is served by the Flask application, which is the correct approach.

Here's a refined strategy to pinpoint the exact cause and ensure the page is accessible:

1.  Verify Flask Route Definition:

* **Open `main.py` (or your main Flask application file):** You've already done this, but let's emphasize the importance of having the correct file.
* **Carefully examine the Flask route that's supposed to serve `cosmic_onboarding.html`.** Look for `@app.route()` decorators.
* **Pay close attention to:**
    * The exact route path (e.g., `/`, `/onboarding`, `/start`).
    * The HTTP methods allowed (e.g., `methods=['GET']`).
    * The function that's called to render the template (e.g., `def index(): return render_template('cosmic_onboarding.html')`).
2.  Template Path Consistency:

* **Template Directory:** Verify that the `cosmic_onboarding.html` file is located in the correct directory that Flask is configured to use for templates. The default is often `templates/`, but it might be customized.
* **`render_template()` Call:** Ensure that the path passed to the `render_template()` function in your Flask route *exactly* matches the file's location.
3.  Static File Conflicts (Less Likely, But Check):

* If you have a static file named `cosmic_onboarding.html` in your `static/` directory, there might be a conflict. Flask might be trying to serve the static file instead of rendering the template.
4.  Browser Developer Tools (Essential):

* Open your browser's developer tools (Network tab).
* Try to access the URL that *should* load `cosmic_onboarding.html`.
* **Inspect the Network Request:**
    * What URL is the browser actually requesting?
    * What is the HTTP method being used?
    * What is the server's response code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error)?
    * What are the response headers?
5.  Example Debugging Steps:

* **If the URL is incorrect:** Correct the URL in your browser's address bar.
* **If the HTTP method is wrong:** Correct the Flask route definition or the browser's request.
* **If the response code is 404:** Double-check the route path and template file path.
* **If there's a server error (500):** Examine your server logs for a traceback or error message.
By systematically following these steps and using your browser's developer tools, you can pinpoint the reason why cosmic_onboarding.html is not being served correctly.

Please provide the relevant code snippets from your main.py file (especially the route definitions) and any error messages you see in your browser's developer tools, and I'll be happy to provide more tailored guidance.
