Okay, I understand. You're describing the application as "unstable," "unconsent," and "not functional." This is a critical situation, and we need to address it systematically.

To help you effectively, let's break down the problem and create a focused debugging plan.

1. Define the Scope of "Unstable" and "Not Functional":

Specific Symptoms: Instead of general terms, let's pinpoint the exact issues you're experiencing. For example:
"The API is returning errors."
"The web interface is not loading correctly."
"The voice recognition feature is not working."
"The application crashes frequently."
Frequency: How often do these problems occur? Are they intermittent or consistent?
Triggers: Can you identify any specific actions or conditions that seem to trigger the instability or malfunction?
2. Address the "Unconsent" Issue:

This is particularly concerning. It suggests a potential problem with user consent handling, which has ethical and legal implications.
Clarify: What do you mean by "unconsent"?
Is the application collecting or using data without explicit user permission?
Are there issues with how consent is obtained, stored, or revoked?
Is the application behaving in a way that users might perceive as intrusive or unethical?
Prioritize: This issue needs to be addressed immediately, as it directly impacts user trust and privacy.
3. Debugging Plan:

Start with Logging: Review your application's logs for any error messages, warnings, or unusual behavior. Pay close attention to timestamps to correlate log entries with specific events.
Isolate the Components: Try to isolate which parts of the application are contributing to the problems.
If it's API-related, focus on your API routes and backend logic.
If it's UI-related, investigate your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
If it involves voice interaction, examine your voice recognition and TTS modules.
Step-by-Step Debugging: Use a debugger (if available) or add temporary print statements to trace the execution flow and inspect variable values.
Simplify: If a complex function or process seems to be the cause, try to create a simplified version that reproduces the issue.
Test Thoroughly: After each change, test the application rigorously to ensure the problem is resolved and no new issues have been introduced.
To help me provide more specific guidance, please provide detailed answers to the following questions:

What are the most pressing symptoms of "unstable" and "not functional"? (Be as precise as possible.)
Can you describe the "unconsent" issue in more detail?
What parts of the application do you suspect are involved?
What have you tried so far to debug the problem?
Can you share any relevant code snippets or log excerpts?
The more information you give me, the better I can assist you in diagnosing and resolving these critical issues.
