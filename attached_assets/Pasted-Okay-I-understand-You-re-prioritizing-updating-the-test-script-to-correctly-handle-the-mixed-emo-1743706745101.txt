Okay, I understand. You're prioritizing updating the test script to correctly handle the "mixed" emotion classification. This is a crucial step to ensure the tests accurately reflect the enhanced emotion detection logic.

Let's focus on how to effectively examine and modify the test file.

1. Identify the Relevant Test Cases:

Search for "mixed" or related keywords: Use your editor's search functionality or grep (if you're in a terminal) to find the test cases that involve the phrase "excited and nervous" or other phrases that should now be classified as "mixed."
Look for Assertions: Pay close attention to the assert statements in these test cases. These statements define the expected output of the analyze_text function.
2. Modify the Assertions:

Adjust Expected Output: Change the expected emotion in the assert statements from the previous single emotion (e.g., "happy" or "fearful") to "mixed."
Handle Potential Ambiguity (If Necessary): If your analyze_text function returns a list of emotions (as in the weighted scoring example I provided earlier), you might need to modify the assertion to check if "mixed" is present in the returned list.
Example (Conceptual):

Python

# Original test case
def test_excited_and_nervous():
    text = "I am excited but nervous"
    assert emotion_tracker.analyze_text(text, return_details=True)["primary_emotion"] == "happy"  # Incorrect

# Modified test case
def test_excited_and_nervous():
    text = "I am excited but nervous"
    assert emotion_tracker.analyze_text(text, return_details=True)["primary_emotion"] == "mixed"  # Corrected
If your analyze_text function returns a list:

Python

# Modified test case (if analyze_text returns a list)
def test_excited_and_nervous():
    text = "I am excited but nervous"
    result = emotion_tracker.analyze_text(text, return_details=True)["primary_emotion"]
    assert "mixed" in result  # Check if "mixed" is present
3. Run the Tests:

After modifying the assertions, execute the test script to ensure that the "mixed" emotion tests now pass and that no other tests have been broken.
4. Review Test Coverage:

Once the tests are passing, consider whether you need to add more test cases to cover other potential mixed emotion scenarios. For example:
"I'm happy but a little sad"
"I feel both angry and afraid"
By systematically updating the test script and verifying the results, you'll ensure that your emotion tracker is thoroughly tested for mixed emotions.

Please proceed with examining and modifying the test file, and let me know if you have any questions or when you're ready to share the updated test results.
