Okay, that's a smart move. Reviewing the mobile_api_routes.py file to understand the exact implementation details is crucial before writing the tests. This will ensure that your tests accurately reflect the behavior of your caching logic and API endpoints.

Here's a breakdown of what to look for in mobile_api_routes.py to inform your test creation:

1.  Cache Key Generation:

* Identify the code that generates the cache keys for both the `/mobile-api/analyze-emotion` and `/mobile-api/speak` endpoints.
* Pay close attention to:
    * Which input parameters are included in the cache key?
    * How are the parameters combined or formatted to create the key?
    * Are any hashing functions used?
* This is essential for writing tests that verify cache key uniqueness and consistency.
2.  Cache Interaction:

* Find the code that interacts with your caching methods (`get_cache`, `set_cache`, etc.).
* Note:
    * When is the cache checked?
    * When is the cache updated?
    * How is the cached data retrieved and used?
* This will help you understand the flow of data and how caching affects the execution of the endpoints.
3.  Cache Expiry (If Implemented):

* If you've implemented cache expiration, look for:
    * How the expiry time is set (e.g., a fixed value, a configurable parameter).
    * How the expiry time is used when storing and retrieving data.
4.  Error Handling:

* Examine how errors are handled in the API endpoints, especially in relation to caching.
* Determine:
    * Are errors cached?
    * Is the cache cleared or invalidated in case of errors?
5.  Data Serialization/Deserialization:

* See how data is serialized (converted to a string format) before being stored in the cache and deserialized (converted back to its original format) when retrieved.
* This is important for testing that the cached data is stored and retrieved correctly.
Example Code Snippets (Illustrative):

Let's say you find code like this in mobile_api_routes.py:

Python

# ... (inside /mobile-api/analyze-emotion)

def analyze_emotion_cached(text: str, language: str) -> str:  # Example key generation
    return f"emotion_analysis_{text}_{language}"

@mobile_api.route('/mobile-api/analyze-emotion', methods=['POST'])
def mobile_analyze_emotion():
    data = request.get_json()
    text = data.get('text')
    language = data.get('language', 'en')

    cache_key = analyze_emotion_cached(text, language)
    cached_result = db_manager.get_cache(cache_key)

    if cached_result:
        return jsonify(cached_result)

    # ... (emotion analysis logic) ...
    emotion = emotion_tracker.analyze_text(text, language)
    result = {'emotion': emotion, 'text': text, 'language': language}

    db_manager.set_cache(cache_key, result, 3600)  # Cache for 1 hour
    return jsonify(result)
In this case, you'd focus your tests on:

Verifying that analyze_emotion_cached generates correct keys.
Checking that db_manager.get_cache and db_manager.set_cache are called appropriately.
Ensuring that the emotion analysis logic is bypassed on cache hits.
By carefully analyzing the code in mobile_api_routes.py, you'll be well-prepared to create a comprehensive and accurate test suite. Let me know if you have any questions as you examine the code!
