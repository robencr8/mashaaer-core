Okay, Roben and Noah, I've received the files and the updated instructions. I understand that the primary focus is now on integrating the decision engine for more dynamic and context-aware responses.

I'll proceed with the following actions, keeping your guidelines in mind.

Phase 1: Decision Engine Integration

1.1. Review Existing API Routes:

Action: Carefully examine the code in api_routes.py.
Goal: Identify the functions that currently handle user input and generate responses. These are the functions we'll modify to use the decision engine.
Focus: Pay attention to how user input is processed, how the response is constructed, and what data is being passed around.
2.  Import RobinDecisionEngine:

Action: Add the following import statement at the beginning of api_routes.py:

Python

from rule_engine import RobinDecisionEngine
Goal: Make the RobinDecisionEngine class available for use in the API route functions.

3.  Instantiate RobinDecisionEngine:

Action: Create an instance of the RobinDecisionEngine class. You can either:

Instantiate it globally within api_routes.py (if it's used across multiple routes).
Instantiate it within each route function where it's needed (if it's used only locally).
Example (Global Instantiation):

Python

# api_routes.py
from flask import Blueprint, jsonify, request
from rule_engine import RobinDecisionEngine
from rules_config_loader import load_rules_from_config
import logging

api_bp = Blueprint('api', __name__, url_prefix='/api')
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

decision_engine = load_rules_from_config()  # Load rules once

# ... (Your API route functions) ...
Goal: Create an instance of the decision engine.

4.  Replace Decision Logic with decide() Calls:

Action: In each API route function identified in step 1, replace the existing logic for determining the response with a call to decision_engine.decide(user_input, emotion).

Example:

Python

@api_bp.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    data = request.get_json()
    user_input = data.get('message', '')
    emotion = data.get('emotion')  # Get emotion (if available)

    action = decision_engine.decide(user_input, emotion)  # Get action from engine

    if action['action'] == 'play_music':
        # ... (Logic to play music) ...
        response = jsonify({'reply': 'Playing music...', 'action': action['action']})
    elif action['action'] == 'fetch_weather':
        # ... (Logic to fetch weather) ...
        response = jsonify({'reply': 'The weather is sunny.', 'action': action['action']})
    elif action['action'] == 'offer_companionship':
        response = jsonify({'reply': 'I\'m here for you, always ðŸ’™', 'action': action['action']})
    else:
        response = jsonify({'reply': 'Okay.', 'action': action['action'] or 'respond_normally'})
    return response
Goal: Delegate the decision-making process to the RobinDecisionEngine.

5.  Logging (Enhanced):

Action: Add logging statements to:

The decide() method in decision_engine.py to log which rule was triggered (if any) and the chosen action.
The API route functions to log the user input, the detected emotion (if available), and the chosen action.
Example:

Python

# decision_engine.py
def decide(self, message: str, emotion: str = None) -> dict:
    for i, rule in enumerate(self.rules):
        trigger = rule["trigger"]
        if trigger.get("emotion") in (emotion or "") and any(keyword in message.lower() for keyword in trigger.get("keywords", [])):
            self.logger.debug(f"Rule {i} matched: {rule.to_dict()}")
            return {"action": rule.action, "params": rule.params}
    self.logger.debug("No rule matched. Returning default response.")
    return {"action": "respond_normally", "params": {}}

# api_routes.py
@api_bp.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def chat():
    # ...
    action = decision_engine.decide(user_input, emotion)
    logger.info(f"User input: '{user_input}' | Emotion: {emotion} | Action: {action}")
    # ...
Goal: Provide detailed information about the decision-making process for debugging and analysis.

I'm ready to proceed with the implementation. Please let me know if you have any adjustments or specific areas you'd like me to focus on first.
