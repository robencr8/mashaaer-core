Okay, you've been meticulously examining the code and identifying the correct approach to updating the fetch() calls. You've correctly recognized that the initial changes introduced syntax errors and that a more targeted approach is needed.

Here's a refined strategy to ensure you accurately update the JavaScript code and avoid further issues:

1.  Precise Identification of the Incorrect fetch() Call:

* You've already used `grep -n -A 3 -B 3 "fetch.*listen-for-voice" cosmic_onboarding.html` to pinpoint the problematic `fetch()` call on line 994. This is excellent!
* **Double-check:** Before making any changes, carefully review the code surrounding that line to ensure you have a complete understanding of its context.
2.  Targeted Replacement:

* Instead of using a broad `sed` pattern that might inadvertently modify other parts of the code, use a very specific pattern that targets *only* the incorrect `fetch()` call.
* **Example (Illustrative):**

    ```bash
    sed -i '994s/fetch(\'\/api\/listen-for-voice?language=' + selectedLanguage + '\')/fetch(\'\/api\/listen-for-voice\', { method: \'POST\', headers: { \'Content-Type\': \'application\/json\' }, body: JSON.stringify({ language: selectedLanguage }) })/g' templates/cosmic_onboarding.html
    ```

    * **Explanation:**
        * `994s/ ... / ... /g`: This `sed` command specifically targets line 994 for substitution.
        * `fetch(\'\...` and `\'\)`: These parts ensure you're only matching the `fetch()` call with the exact URL you intend to modify.
        * The rest of the pattern captures the `selectedLanguage` variable and constructs the correct `fetch()` call with the `POST` method, headers, and body.
3.  Thorough Verification:

* **Inspect the Modified File:** After running the `sed` command, open `templates/cosmic_onboarding.html` in a text editor and carefully inspect the changed line (and a few lines around it) to ensure the replacement was done correctly.
* **Browser Testing:**
    * Load the `cosmic_onboarding.html` page in your browser.
    * Open your browser's developer tools (Network tab).
    * Interact with the page in a way that triggers the `/api/listen-for-voice` endpoint.
    * Verify in the Network tab that the request is now being sent as a `POST` request with the correct headers and body.
    * Check for any errors in the browser console.
* **Full Application Testing:** Once you're confident that the `fetch()` call is correct, test the entire application to ensure that the voice input functionality is working as expected and that no other features have been affected.
By following these steps, you can ensure that you're making the necessary changes accurately and without introducing any unintended side effects.
