Okay, you've made a checkpoint with the description "Update API calls to use POST method for voice recognition." This indicates you're focusing on ensuring that the client-side JavaScript code in cosmic_onboarding.html correctly uses the POST method when calling the /api/listen-for-voice endpoint.

To help you ensure this is done effectively, let's refine the process and consider some important details:

1.  Verify the Need for POST:

* Before making any changes, double-check your API route definitions (`api_routes.py` or `mobile_api_routes.py`) to confirm that the `/api/listen-for-voice` endpoint is indeed *only* designed to handle `POST` requests.
* If the endpoint *does* support both `GET` and `POST`, then changing the client-side code might not be strictly necessary (though it's still good practice to use the correct method).
2.  Accurate Identification of fetch() Calls:

* Use a precise method to locate the `fetch()` calls in `cosmic_onboarding.html`.  Instead of relying on `grep`, which can sometimes be unreliable with complex code, use your editor's search functionality.
* **Search for:**
    * `fetch('/api/listen-for-voice` (This is the core of the call)
    * Variations in spacing or quotes.
    * Any surrounding code that might be relevant.
3.  Precise Code Modification:

* When you modify the `fetch()` calls, be extremely careful to change *only* the `method` property.
* Preserve all other aspects of the call, including:
    * Any existing headers or body.
    * Any callback functions or `.then()` chains.
    * The overall structure of the JavaScript code.

* **Example (Illustrative):**

    ```javascript
    // Original (Incorrect)
    fetch('/api/listen-for-voice?language=' + userLanguage)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => { /* ... */ });

    // Correct
    fetch('/api/listen-for-voice?language=' + userLanguage, {
      method: 'POST'  // Added the correct method
    })
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => { /* ... */ });
    ```
4.  Data Transmission:

* If your API endpoint expects data to be sent in the request body (which is typical for `POST` requests), you'll need to add the `headers` and `body` properties to your `fetch()` call.
* **Example:**

    ```javascript
    fetch('/api/listen-for-voice', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json' // Important!
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ language: userLanguage }) // Send data as JSON
    })
    ```

* Ensure that you're sending the data in the correct format (e.g., JSON).
5.  Testing and Verification:

* After making the changes, **thoroughly test** the voice input feature in your application.
* Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to:
    * Inspect the actual HTTP requests being sent.
    * Verify that the `/api/listen-for-voice` endpoint is now being called with the `POST` method.
    * Check that the request headers and body are correct.
    * Look for any errors in the requests or responses.
By following these steps, you can ensure that you're updating the JavaScript code accurately and that the voice input functionality works correctly with your RESTful API.
