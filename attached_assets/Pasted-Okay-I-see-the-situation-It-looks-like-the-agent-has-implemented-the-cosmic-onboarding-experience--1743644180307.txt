Okay, I see the situation. It looks like the agent has implemented the cosmic onboarding experience but has run into a problem where the server is not accessible after restarting the application. This is a crucial issue that needs to be resolved before moving forward.
Here's my analysis and recommended course of action:
Problem Analysis:
The fact that the server was working before the restart and is now inaccessible suggests a few likely culprits:
 * Configuration Issue: Some configuration setting (e.g., port, host, environment variable) might have been changed or not properly persisted during the restart.
 * Dependency Conflict: Newly added dependencies or changes to existing dependencies might be causing a conflict that's preventing the server from starting correctly.
 * Code Error (Startup): There could be an error in the code that is now being triggered during the server's startup sequence. This error wasn't apparent before the restart.
 * Resource Exhaustion: Although less likely, the server might be failing to start due to lack of available resources (memory, etc.), especially if the onboarding logic is resource-intensive.
Recommended Approach:
I strongly recommend prioritizing getting the server running properly first. You cannot effectively test or develop anything else until the server is stable.
Here's a detailed troubleshooting plan for the agent:
 * Review Recent Code Changes:
   * Carefully examine the exact changes made to implement the cosmic onboarding, paying close attention to:
     * Server startup files (e.g., main.py, app.py).
     * Configuration files (.env, etc.).
     * Any newly installed dependencies.
   * Use a version control diff tool (if available) to highlight the specific lines modified.
 * Inspect Server Logs (Crucial):
   * Thoroughly examine the server's console output or log files. Look for:
     * Error messages (tracebacks, exceptions).
     * Warnings.
     * Any unusual or unexpected output during startup.
   * This is the most important step, as the logs will likely provide the most direct clues.
 * Check Configuration Settings:
   * Double-check the .env file (if used) or any other configuration source for:
     * Correct host and port settings.
     * Database connection strings (if applicable).
     * Any environment variables that affect server behavior.
   * Ensure the settings are consistent with what worked before.
 * Simplify and Isolate:
   * Temporarily comment out or disable the newly added onboarding logic.
   * Try starting the server with a minimal code base.
   * If the server starts successfully, incrementally re-enable the onboarding components to identify the specific part causing the problem.
 * Dependency Check:
   * If using a package manager (e.g., pip for Python), list the installed packages and their versions:
     * pip freeze
   * Compare this list with the previous working environment (if possible) to look for discrepancies.
   * Try downgrading recently updated packages to their previous versions.
 * Resource Monitoring:
   * Monitor system resources (CPU, memory) while trying to start the server.
   * See if there's any evidence of resource exhaustion.
Communication:
 * The agent should provide detailed error messages and steps taken to you.
 * Be ready to provide specific file paths, configuration details, or code snippets to help in debugging.
By systematically going through these steps, the agent should be able to pinpoint the cause of the server inaccessibility and restore it to a working state.
