You're taking a very methodical and proactive approach to isolate and resolve the web application feedback tool issue. Creating simplified servers and test pages is a great strategy to pinpoint where the incompatibility lies.
Here's a breakdown of your actions and some guidance on how to proceed:
Summary of Your Actions:
 * Simplified Test Page: You created templates/minimal_test.html to serve a basic HTML page.
 * Health Check Endpoint: You added and refined a health check endpoint (/api/status) in main.py.
 * Root Route Override: You experimented with overriding the root route in routes_feedback_tool.py.
 * Enhanced CORS: You've been working on the enhanced_cors.py file to configure CORS headers.
 * Standalone Test Servers: You've created test_server_minimal.py and ultra_simple_server.py to test server compatibility.
 * Workflow Adjustments: You've attempted to modify the .replit file and use shell commands (nohup, pkill, kill) to manage server processes.
 * File Exploration: You've been carefully examining files like main.py, routes_feedback_tool.py, and config.py.
Observations and Key Strengths:
 * Isolation Strategy: You're effectively employing isolation techniques to narrow down the problem.
 * Persistence: You're not giving up and are trying various approaches.
 * Systematic Debugging: You're following a logical sequence of steps.
Recommended Next Steps:
Given your current progress, here's a refined strategy:
 * Prioritize the Ultra-Simple Server (ultra_simple_server.py)
   * Action: Focus on getting the ultra_simple_server.py working reliably with the feedback tool. This is the best approach for isolating the issue.
   * Reasoning: If the feedback tool can connect to this extremely basic server, it strongly suggests that the problem lies in the complexity or configuration of your main Flask application.
 * Debugging the Ultra-Simple Server
   * Action: If ultra_simple_server.py doesn't work, carefully debug it.
   * Specific Checks:
     * Port and Host: Ensure it's listening on the correct port and host.
     * CORS (in ultra_simple_server.py): Be very explicit and restrictive with CORS headers in this server. Only allow the exact origin, methods, and headers that the feedback tool uses.
     * Logging: Add detailed logging to this server to track requests and responses.
     * Network Analysis: Use tcpdump or Wireshark to capture the raw network traffic between the feedback tool and this server.
 * Iterative Testing with the Feedback Tool
   * Action: After each change to ultra_simple_server.py, test immediately with the feedback tool.
   * Reasoning: This allows you to quickly identify what works and what doesn't.
 * If ultra_simple_server.py Works
   * Action: If the feedback tool connects to the ultra-simple server, then the problem is likely in your main Flask application.
   * Action: In that case, carefully compare the configurations, headers, and request/response patterns of the ultra-simple server and your main Flask application.
 * Revisit Flask Configuration (If Necessary)
   * Action: If the problem is in your main Flask application, revisit the following:
     * CORS: Pay very close attention to the flask_cors configuration.
     * Routing: Ensure that all routes are defined correctly.
     * Middleware: Check for any middleware that might be interfering.
     * Server Setup: If you're using a server like Gunicorn or Waitress, double-check its configuration.
 * Document and Simplify
   * Action: Document all your findings and the steps you've taken.
   * Action: Aim to simplify your code and configuration as much as possible.
By focusing on the ultra-simple server and using network analysis, you'll be able to isolate and resolve the feedback tool connectivity problem more effectively.
