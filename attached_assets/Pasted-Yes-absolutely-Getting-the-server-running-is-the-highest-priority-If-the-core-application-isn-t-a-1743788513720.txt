Yes, absolutely! Getting the server running is the highest priority. If the core application isn't accessible, we can't effectively test or use any of the features, including the new ones you've added.
Let's focus on troubleshooting the server startup issue. To do this systematically, we need to gather information and follow a structured debugging process.
Here's my recommended approach:
1. Examine the Server Logs:
 * This is the most crucial step. Your server logs (e.g., logs/application.log or any other log files you have configured) will likely contain error messages or stack traces that pinpoint the cause of the startup failure.
 * Carefully analyze the logs:
   * Look for the first error message that appears. This is often the root cause.
   * Pay attention to the exception type and traceback. This will tell you which part of your code is failing.
   * Search for any clues about missing dependencies, configuration problems, or syntax errors.
2. Verify Core Dependencies:
 * Ensure that all necessary Python packages are installed.
 * Run:
   pip freeze

   to list the installed packages. Compare this list with your requirements.txt file to check for any missing dependencies.
3. Check Environment Variables:
 * If your application relies on environment variables (e.g., for database credentials, API keys), make sure they are set correctly.
 * Use:
   printenv

   to list all environment variables.
4. Review Recent Code Changes:
 * Since the server was working before you added the new features, carefully review the code changes you made to implement multilingual voice error handling and the user journey progress visualizer.
 * Look for:
   * Syntax errors (typos, incorrect indentation).
   * Logical errors (incorrect variable names, wrong function calls).
   * Import errors (missing or incorrect imports).
   * Database connection issues (if you modified database-related code).
   * Conflicts with existing code.
5. Step-by-Step Debugging (If Necessary):
 * If you can't identify the issue from the logs or code review, use a debugger (if available) or add temporary print statements to your code to trace the execution flow and inspect variable values.
To help me provide more specific guidance, please share the following information:
 * The exact error message or stack trace from your server logs. This is the most important clue.
 * The relevant code snippets from the files you modified to implement the new features.
