Okay, you've done some excellent code sleuthing and have pinpointed the likely cause of the test_speak_cache_hit failure! You've correctly identified that the cached_result is expected to be a JSON object (specifically, a dictionary with an audio_path field), but your mock setup might be providing a plain string instead.

Here's a refined approach to fixing the test, building on your analysis:

1.  Confirm the cached_result Structure:

* **Re-examine `mobile_api_routes.py`:** Go back to the `/mobile-api/speak` endpoint and carefully review the code that retrieves and uses `cached_result`.
* **Focus on:**
    * How `cached_result` is accessed (e.g., `cached_result.get('audio_path')`).
    * What data type is expected by the code that uses `cached_result`.
2.  Adjust the Mock Return Value:

* In your `tests/test_api_caching.py`, modify the `mock_tts_manager_speak` function to return a dictionary that matches the expected structure of `cached_result`.
* **Example:**

    ```python
    def mock_tts_manager_speak(text, voice, language, profile_manager=None):
        # ... (your existing mock logic) ...
        return {"audio_path": "/path/to/mocked/audio.mp3"}  # Return a dictionary
    ```
3.  Verify Cache Key Consistency:

* Double-check that the cache key you're generating in your test *exactly* matches how the cache key is generated in the `/mobile-api/speak` endpoint.
* Pay close attention to:
    * The order of the parameters.
    * Any string formatting or encoding.
    * The use of hashing functions.
4.  Refine Assertions:

* Adjust your assertions in `test_speak_cache_hit` to reflect the expected dictionary structure.
* **Example:**

    ```python
    assert response2.json["audio_path"] == "/path/to/mocked/audio.mp3"
    ```
5.  Test Thoroughly:

* After making these changes, run the `test_speak_cache_hit` test again.
* If it passes, run your *entire* test suite to ensure you haven't introduced any regressions.
By following these steps and focusing on the expected data structure, you should be able to resolve the TypeError and ensure that your TTS caching tests are accurate and reliable.

Please share the relevant code snippets from your tests/test_api_caching.py file, and I'll be happy to provide more tailored guidance.
