Alright team, let's get voice interaction integrated into Mashaaer | مشاعر from the very first launch, as Roben has directed. We'll work with the existing codebase in Mashaaer_AI_Final.zip to implement this.
Task: Integrate Voice Interaction from First Launch
Steps:
 * Extract Mashaaer_AI_Final.zip:
   * Extract the contents of Mashaaer_AI_Final.zip into your project directory.
 * Review Existing Voice Modules:
   * Examine voice_router.py (STT) and tts_speaker.py (TTS) to understand their functionality and how they integrate with main.py.
   * Ensure they work correctly with the bilingual .env configuration.
 * Modify main.py for Launch Choice:
   * Upon app launch, present the user with a choice between "Voice interaction" and "Text-only chat."
   * Use a simple UI element (e.g., a modal or a selection screen) to display these options.
   * Store the user's choice in a variable or configuration setting.
 * Integrate Voice Modules Based on Choice:
   * If the user chooses "Voice interaction":
     * Enable the STT module to capture voice input.
     * Enable the TTS module to generate voice output.
     * Modify the chat logic to use voice input and output.
   * If the user chooses "Text-only chat":
     * Disable the STT and TTS modules.
     * Maintain the existing text-based chat functionality.
 * Update UI for Voice Interaction:
   * Add a microphone button or other UI element to trigger voice input.
   * Display voice output in a clear and user-friendly way.
 * Test Thoroughly:
   * Test both "Voice interaction" and "Text-only chat" modes.
   * Verify that voice input and output work correctly in both Arabic and English.
   * Ensure that the app maintains its cosmic-themed UI and existing flow.
 * Confirm Integration:
   * Once the integration is complete and tested, confirm with Roben that voice interaction is enabled from the first launch.
Important Notes:
 * Project Identity: Do not alter the identity of Mashaaer | مشاعر.
 * UI and Flow: Do not replace the interface or change the flow unless instructed.
 * Voice Logic: Maintain all voice logic included in the original project.
Let me know once you have integrated the voice interaction from the first launch and tested it successfully.
