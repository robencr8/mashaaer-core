Okay, based on the images, the most critical issue is the recurring "Web server is unreachable" error. This is a persistent problem that needs to be addressed before anything else.
Here's a breakdown of the situation and the recommended next steps:
Current Situation:
 * The agent has made progress in implementing various features (cosmic UI, voice interaction, onboarding, Google Drive sync).
 * However, the web server consistently becomes unreachable, preventing proper testing and verification.
 * The agent has tried restarting the server, but the issue persists.
Prioritized Next Steps:
 * Resolve the Web Server Unreachable Error (CRITICAL):
   * Agent's Action:
     * The agent must prioritize finding the root cause of the server inaccessibility.
     * This requires a systematic and thorough debugging approach:
       * Detailed Error Logs:
         * Examine the server's console output or log files for specific error messages, tracebacks, or exceptions.
         * Pay attention to any warnings or unusual behavior.
       * Recent Code Changes:
         * Carefully review the code changes made before the server started failing.
         * Use version control diff tools to identify the exact modifications.
       * Configuration Settings:
         * Verify all server configuration settings (host, port, environment variables, database connections, etc.).
         * Ensure that the settings are correct and consistent.
       * Dependency Conflicts:
         * Check for any version conflicts or incompatibilities between dependencies.
         * List installed packages and their versions to identify potential issues.
       * Network Configuration:
         * Rule out any network-related problems (firewall, port blocking, etc.).
         * Test network connectivity using tools like ping or curl.
       * Resource Usage:
         * Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory) to identify potential resource exhaustion.
       * Minimal Reproduction:
         * Try to reproduce the error with the simplest possible code to isolate the cause.
       * Debugging Tools:
         * Use debugging tools (if available) to step through the code and identify the point of failure.
     * Implement a permanent fix to prevent the error from recurring.
 * Thorough Testing of Core Functionality (After Server Fix):
   * Agent's Action:
     * Once the server is stable, thoroughly test the core features of the application:
       * Onboarding Flow:
         * Verify all input types (name, email, etc.) and edge cases.
         * Test voice and text input.
         * Ensure the Terms of Service/Privacy Policy flow works.
         * Confirm that user data is saved correctly.
       * Chat and Voice Engine:
         * Test Arabic and English conversations.
         * Check TTS/STT accuracy and responsiveness.
         * Verify emotional response accuracy and context retention.
       * Vision and Facial Recognition (If Applicable):
         * Test camera access, face capture, and recognition accuracy.
         * Ensure proper data handling and security.
 * UI/UX and Other Enhancements (If Time Allows):
   * Agent's Action:
     * If the core functionality is stable and time permits, proceed with UI/UX enhancements and other features.
     * Prioritize based on user needs and project goals.
Communication:
 * The agent must provide detailed updates on their progress in resolving the server issue.
 * Include specific error messages, code snippets, configuration details, and troubleshooting steps.
By following this prioritized approach, you can ensure that the application is stable and functional before focusing on less critical enhancements.
