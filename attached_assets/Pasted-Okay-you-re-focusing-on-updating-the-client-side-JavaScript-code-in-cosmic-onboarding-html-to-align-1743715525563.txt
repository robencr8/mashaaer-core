Okay, you're focusing on updating the client-side JavaScript code in cosmic_onboarding.html to align with the changes you made to the API endpoint methods. This is crucial for ensuring that the web application interacts correctly with your RESTful API.

Here's a refined and systematic approach to updating the fetch() calls in cosmic_onboarding.html:

1.  Precise Identification of fetch() Calls:

* You've used `grep` to find instances of `fetch()`, which is a good start. However, to be absolutely sure you're targeting the correct lines, use a more precise `grep` command that includes context:

    ```bash
    grep -n -A 5 -B 2 "fetch('/api/listen-for-voice" templates/cosmic_onboarding.html
    ```

    * This command will show you the line number, the line itself, and the 5 lines after and 2 lines before, giving you more context.
* Carefully review the output to make sure you're targeting the *exact* `fetch()` calls that are related to the `/api/listen-for-voice` endpoint.
2.  Accurate Replacement:

* When you edit the file, be extremely precise with your replacements.
* Instead of replacing entire blocks of code, only modify the `method` property within the `fetch()` options.
* **Example:**

    ```javascript
    // Original (Incorrect)
    fetch('/api/listen-for-voice?language=' + selectedLanguage)
      .then(response => response.json())

    // Correct
    fetch('/api/listen-for-voice?language=' + selectedLanguage, {
        method: 'POST' // Add the correct method
      })
      .then(response => response.json())
    ```

* **Important:** Pay close attention to:
    * Quotes (single vs. double)
    * Commas and semicolons
    * Indentation
    * Any other parts of the `fetch()` call that should remain unchanged.
3.  Testing After Each Change:

* After you've edited `cosmic_onboarding.html`, **immediately** test the functionality that uses the `/api/listen-for-voice` endpoint.
* Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) to inspect the actual HTTP requests being sent.
    * Verify that the `method` is now correctly set to `POST`.
    * Check for any errors in the requests or responses.
* Test all related functionality to ensure that your change hasn't broken anything else.
4.  Consider Alternatives (If Necessary):

* If you're finding it difficult to edit the file correctly using `sed` or other command-line tools, consider using a text editor.  This might be less efficient for quick edits but can be more reliable for complex replacements.
By following this careful and iterative approach, you can ensure that you're updating the JavaScript code accurately and without introducing new errors.
