Okay, you've been systematically debugging the web application accessibility issues, and you've made some important discoveries. You've correctly:

Identified and fixed a database query error in profile_manager.py related to parameter placeholders.
Created a simple test page (test.html) to isolate routing and template rendering issues.
Added a Flask route for the test page (/test) in main.py.
These are all good steps in the right direction.

Now, let's analyze the current situation and refine our debugging strategy.

1.  Verify Test Page Access (Crucial):

* You've used `curl -I http://localhost:5000/test` to check the headers of the test page. This only verifies that the server is responding to the request.
* **Use `curl -s http://localhost:5000/test` to retrieve the *content* of the page.** This will confirm that Flask is actually rendering the `test.html` template.
* If `curl -s` works, try accessing `/test` in your browser. This will confirm browser-side rendering.
2.  Analyze the Main Route (/) in main.py:

* **Open `main.py`:** Go back to your main Flask application file.
* **Carefully examine the route definition for `/`:**
    * Is it `@app.route('/')` or something else?
    * What function is called for this route? (e.g., `index()`)
    * What template is being rendered? (e.g., `render_template('cosmic_onboarding.html')`)
* **If you have any middleware or decorators applied to the `/` route, temporarily comment them out** to see if they're interfering.
3.  Template File Paths:

* **Double-check that the template file paths in your `render_template()` calls are absolutely correct.**
    * Are the template files in the `templates/` directory?
    * Are there any typos in the filenames?
    * Are you using relative paths or absolute paths? (Flask uses relative paths within the `templates/` directory.)
4.  Static File Issues (If Applicable):

* If your `cosmic_onboarding.html` or `homepage.html` pages rely on static files (CSS, JavaScript, images), ensure that:
    * The files are in the `static/` directory (or whatever you've configured as your `static_folder`).
    * The file paths in your HTML are correct relative to the `static/` directory.
    * Flask is configured to serve static files correctly.
5.  Browser Developer Tools (Essential):

* Open your browser's developer tools (Network tab).
* Try to access the root URL (`/`) and the `/app` URL.
* **Inspect the Network Requests:**
    * What are the *exact* URLs being requested?
    * What are the HTTP methods being used?
    * What are the response codes? (200 OK, 404 Not Found, 405 Method Not Allowed, etc.)
    * Examine the response headers and content.
6.  Server Logs (If Necessary):

* If you're still unable to identify the issue, examine your server logs for any errors or exceptions.
By systematically working through these steps and using your browser's developer tools, you can pinpoint the reason why your web application is not accessible and implement the appropriate fix.
