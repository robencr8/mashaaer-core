🔧 CONFIGURATION PHASE:

1. ✅ **Activate Full Node Environment**
- Ensure `server.js` is the main entry point
- All dependencies must be resolved from `package.json`
- Environment variables loaded from `.env`

2. ✅ **Frontend Setup**
- Serve `/index.html` or equivalent from `public/` or `src/frontend/`
- Connect all JS modules:
  - `app.js`, `voice-agent.js`, `emotions.js`, `subscription.js`
- Bind canvas rendering (cosmic UI) as the root experience

3. ✅ **Routing & API Binding**
