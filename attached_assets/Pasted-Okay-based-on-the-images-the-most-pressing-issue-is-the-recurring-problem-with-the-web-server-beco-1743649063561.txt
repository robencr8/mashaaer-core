Okay, based on the images, the most pressing issue is the recurring problem with the web server becoming unreachable. This needs to be the immediate focus.
Here's a prioritized plan of action:
1.  CRITICAL: Resolve the Web Server Inaccessibility Issue
* Agent's Action:
* Thoroughly investigate why the server is becoming unreachable after restarting the application.
* This requires a systematic approach:
* Check Server Logs: Examine the server's console output or log files for any error messages, warnings, or exceptions.
* Review Recent Changes: Carefully analyze the code changes made before the server started failing. Use version control diffs to pinpoint the exact modifications.
* Configuration Verification: Double-check all configuration settings (e.g., port, host, database connections, environment variables) to ensure they are correct and consistent.
* Dependency Conflicts: If new libraries or dependencies have been added, check for conflicts or version incompatibilities.
* Resource Usage: Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory) to rule out resource exhaustion.
* Minimal Reproduction: Try to reproduce the error with the simplest possible code to isolate the cause.
* Implement a permanent fix to prevent this issue from recurring.
2.  Verify Core Functionality (After Server is Stable)
* Agent's Action:
* Once the server is reliably accessible, thoroughly test the core functionalities:
* Onboarding Flow:
* Test all input types (name, email, etc.) with valid and invalid data.
* Verify voice and text input.
* Ensure the Terms of Service/Privacy Policy flow works.
* Confirm user data is saved correctly.
* Chat and Voice Engine:
* Test Arabic and English conversations.
* Check TTS/STT accuracy and responsiveness.
* Verify emotional response accuracy and context retention.
* Vision and Facial Recognition:
* If implemented, test camera access, face capture, and recognition accuracy.
* Ensure proper data handling and security.
3.  UI/UX and Other Enhancements (If Time Allows)
* Agent's Action:
* If the core functionality is stable and time permits, proceed with UI/UX enhancements and other features.
* Prioritize based on user needs and project goals.
Why this order?
 * Stability is Paramount: The application cannot function without a stable server.
 * Core Functionality is Essential: Users expect the core features (chat, voice, onboarding) to work reliably.
 * Enhancements are Secondary: UI/UX improvements and other features are important but less critical than core functionality.
Crucial Communication:
 * The agent must keep you informed of their progress in resolving the server issue.
 * Provide detailed error messages, code snippets, and configuration information when necessary.
By following this prioritized plan, you can ensure that the application is stable and functional before focusing on less critical enhancements.
