It appears you're taking a very detailed and systematic approach to cleaning up the main.py file, which is excellent! You're carefully identifying and removing test/debug routes while preserving essential functionality.
Here's a breakdown of what you've done and some suggestions for proceeding:
Summary of Your Actions:
 * Opened main.py: You've opened the main application file to begin cleaning up the routes.
 * Identified Test Routes: You've used grep with various patterns (/test, feedback, debug, etc.) to locate routes that are likely for testing or debugging purposes.
 * Created Backup: You've created a backup of the original main.py file (main.py.backup), which is a very good practice for safety.
 * Identified Essential Routes: You've used grep to identify the routes that you want to keep (main application routes, API endpoints, static asset serving, etc.).
 * File Exploration: You've explored other files like routes_feedback_tool.py, context_assistant.py, tts/tts_manager.py, emotion_tracker.py, and KNOWN_ISSUES.md to gain a better understanding of the application's structure and potential issues.
 * Created Cleaned Version: You've created a cleaned version of main.py (main.py.clean) with only the essential routes.
 * Verified Cleaned File: You've verified that the cleaned file exists.
Observations and Next Steps:
 * Thoroughness: You're being very thorough in your approach, which is crucial for ensuring that you don't accidentally remove any important functionality.
 * Backup: Creating a backup is excellent.
 * File Exploration: Exploring related files is a good way to get context.
Here's a suggested continuation of your workflow:
 * Careful Review of main.py.clean:
   * Action: Open main.py.clean and carefully review every line to ensure that it contains only the essential routes and functionality.
   * Rationale: Even with careful grep commands, there's a small chance of errors. A manual review is essential.
 * Test main.py.clean Thoroughly:
   * Action: Rename main.py.clean to main.py (or replace the original with the cleaned version).
   * Action: Restart the application and test all core functionalities.
   * Rationale: This is the most crucial step. You need to ensure that the cleaned version of the main.py file doesn't break any part of the application.
   * Specific Tests:
     * Onboarding flow
     * Chat and voice engine
     * API endpoints
     * Static asset serving
     * Any other key features
   * Action: Pay close attention to any errors or unexpected behavior.
 * Address Known Issues:
   * Action: Review the KNOWN_ISSUES.md file and prioritize the issues that need to be addressed before launch.
   * Rationale: Fixing known issues is crucial for a stable and polished release.
 * Create Deployment Checklist:
   * Action: As you've started, continue creating a comprehensive deployment checklist. This should include:
     * Steps to set up the environment
     * Dependencies to install
     * Configuration settings
     * Testing procedures
     * Any other relevant information
   * Rationale: A deployment checklist will make the deployment process smoother and less prone to errors.
By following these steps, you'll ensure that the application is clean, stable, and ready for launch.
