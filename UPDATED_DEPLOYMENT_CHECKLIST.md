   - Start the application using `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app`
   - Assign a permanent URL

After deployment:
- The application will be available at your Replit app URL
- It can be installed as a Progressive Web App on mobile devices
- It will support offline capabilities
- It will provide the full Mashaaer experience with voice interaction and emotion analysis

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:

1. The application loads correctly at the deployed URL

3. Voice recognition works (requires microphone permission)
4. Text-to-speech functionality works
5. Emotion analysis returns correct results
6. Telegram notifications are successfully delivered
7. The PWA can be installed on mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur:

1. Check the application logs in the Replit console
2. Verify that all required environment variables are set
3. Ensure database connectivity is established
4. Check for CORS issues in the browser console
5. Run the performance test suite to identify specific failures
6. Verify that all API endpoints are responding correctly

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be set:

- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For AI model access
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`: For high-quality TTS
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: For Telegram notifications
- `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`: Destination for Telegram notifications
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`: For SMS alerts

## Final Notes

The Mashaaer Feelings application has been configured for seamless deployment on Replit. The comprehensive performance testing framework ensures that all endpoints are functioning correctly and meet performance requirements. Resilience improvements ensure the application handles third-party service outages gracefully.

The application is now ready for production deployment! ðŸš€
